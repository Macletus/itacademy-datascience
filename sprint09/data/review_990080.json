The developers made a conscious effort to ensure that people from all backgrounds would feel represented and included in the game, and it shows. The characters are diverse and complex, and the story line is both engaging and inclusive.\n\nIt's important to note that while the game was created by a company that has been criticised for its handling of trans issues in the past, there are better ways to fight transphobia than boycotting a video game. Hogwarts Legacy is a labour of love, and the people who worked on it put their hearts and souls into creating an immersive and inclusive experience for all players.\n\nOverall, Hogwarts Legacy is a fantastic game that is sure to delight fans of the Wizarding World.

this game extremely immersive and fun.  the locations are a delight to explore, look at all the animated details, every room is lovingly crafted.  as an adventure game its great.  \npros: easy to explore, fly, map is great to find stuff you missed, every nook and cranny filled with treasure or stuff to do.  its fun getting stronger combat wise, the cut scenes are great, music is immersive and nonintrusive, there are tough combat situations to keep you on your toes, you can choose whichever playstyle is best for you, go dark magic (which have to say has the best spell animations) or stay pure and good, buff out your stealth or buff out potion useage. your call.  all seem viable.  you can choose difficulty level though i recommend staying with normal or hard as combat can be too easy after you get a few spells in.   \n\ncons:\nmap needs player notes addition, long loading scenes for transistions and start up, at higher levels the repetition of mobs, instances etc gets a bit old (they really needed another kind of human mob, not just the poacher ones) ,  choose carefully your avatar looks because you can only change hair styles, color and eye color and scars later.  avatar creation and close up scenes dont look like your in game character at all.   in game char's look hunched over and constipated, its a downer to have to look at a char that youre not invested in the whole game.  decorating colors for your house is a bit tetchy.\n\noverall its a perfect game, i experienced no stuttering, lag or graphic glitches on medium settings (which was still gorgeous) on my

When I started, I was blown away by how much is in the game. I said it was my favorite open-world game next to Breath of the Wild (which still holds the torch). Does that still ring true? Yes, but with some caveats. There are some performance issues with this game, but I will be covering the gameplay aspect of the game here.\n\nSo, how does it fare? Well, I was really worried at first because the story opens up with your character giving you the answer to every single puzzle without allowing you a moment to think for yourself. Then we're shown pointless dialogue trees, a disappointing sorting, and WAY too much HUD information. Every enemy has a healthbar and a level, and we have our health bar and magic meters, and look! Waypoint markers and a path marked on your mini-map! Objective markers hover obnoxiously over NPCs that you need to talk, too, and the worst offender of all, enemies scale with you throughout the game making upgrades effectively limited or worthless.\n\nSo, this open-world is really just taking a page out of the more generic ones out there. Repeating tombs and secret areas that don't really unlock upgrades but just give you unidentified gear as a reward which might slightly up your stats. It's novel at first but wears thin when you realize that it's all the same and loses its appeal quite quickly.\n\nWith all of this negative stuff in here, why am I giving it a positive review? Well, for a few reasons really! Because this game is actually REMARKABLY fun!\n\nFirst, this game is banking on the player being a Harry Potter fan. If you're in love with the wizarding world, then getting to run around Hogwarts and the environment is an absolute treat! I can't tell you how giddy it makes me to see the paintings moving, ghosts sword fighting and floating through the castle, Peeves up to his shenanigans, suits of armor moving out of the corner of your vision or interacting with each other. Oh my god, it is SUCH a treat. And the intricacy of Hogwarts itself is SO fun! It can be almost overwhelming at first, but things fit together in such an intricate and nice way, it feels like I really am exploring a magical castle with tons of secrets within its walls! Although I wish they could have made the Grand Staircase more faithful to the books and movies, everything else feels like its selected the best of both worlds. Certain aspects of the castle are more faithful to the movies while others pull a page or two from the books, and it's wonderful to see\n\nSecond. Accessibility options. Normally, this is a source of contention for me because I usually see accessibility impede the vision of the creator and game rather than support it. But the options they have here (while there is room for improvement--where the hell is my one-stick broom control?) do give you a range of customization. And the first thing I did? I turned off the ENTIRE HUD. I kept things up long enough to learn how they work, but I was able to turn off:\n\n-The minimap\n-My healthbar\n-Enemy health bar/level\n-Wand Spells\n\nI did that all while keeping the display for items that I pick up and EXP notifications. The problem I have with this game is the problem I have with other Action RPG games. They're not RPG games. They are on the surface level, but they're really more Action/Adventure games. RPGs have a very certain feel to them, and I'm not a fan of western RPGs with scaling enemies. It loses that sense of working hard to get stronger which is ESSENTIAL to an RPG experience. All of the combat has to lead to something and make you stronger. And enemies that scale with you take away from that experience.\n\nHowever, as an Action/Adventure title, this system is PERFECT. And you can achieve that feel by removing the levels and health from enemies. You'll get talents that unlock different effects for spells, learn more spells, get better combos, be able to mix and match combos as you want, and that sort of system works SO MUCH BETTER when you remove the arbitrary health values and levels that enemies have. It puts the focus on you, your wits, your spells, and your positioning rather than on whittling down a red bar until it disappears. I understand that this isn't for everyone, nor do these mechanics bother everyone, but scaling enemies is something I take issue with because of how repetitive it makes games feel, and I'm glad there was an option to turn these elements off.\n\nTo go along with that, most games that give you those sort of options are unplayable without them. Sure, Witcher 3 might SAY that you can remove the minimap, but the core gameplay relies on it, so if you don't want to pull up your map every two seconds and ruin the flow, then you need to have it on. I would say that this game does a really good job at being the best of both worlds. You can disable these HUD elements, but still have the game be playable. Oh, don't have your mini-map and are lost? Not to worry! We have a pathfinder similar to Dead Space that you can activate and follow to your objective without too much clutter on the screen. It really is wonderful.\n\nThird. The combos. Oh my god, the combos. The game gives you a rundown very quickly of it's combat. Attack and shield. Attack and shield. Ohp. Super attack. But this is quickly added onto with spells that you learn in class. You start to learn various spells that you can put into your combos. Hit the enemy, levitate them, hit the enemy, pull them toward you, set them on fire, push them away, hit the enemy, thrown an object. Want to sneak up on that enemy? Do it. Wanna throw that guy off a cliff? Have fun! Oh, man. There's some guys below me but I don't really feel like fighting a lot of them. I'm pretty high up though. I'll just pull them to me and let them fall to their death. I have had SO much fun with the combat in this game. Elements of it remind me of Batman: Arkham Asylum. It's not exactly the same, but you have combos that you do while watching for dodge and counter symbols that flash around your character's head (rather than the enemy's). I willingly look for fights because of how much fun I have playing the game.\n\nFourth. The stuff I wasn't expecting. The extra stuff can wear thin, but I was just expecting a game where I ran around a castle and shot some wizards now and then. The fact that I was provided more than that has been thrilling, and quite an enjoyable experience.\n\nAnd that's my review for the game. There's some faults with it, some things get old, and at the end of the day, the world and exploration is like a lot of other open-world games out there. But the gameplay, accessibility features, and the fact that I'm in the wizarding world have made the experience one that has put a smile on my face the whole way through.", "timestamp_created": 1677436586, "timestamp_updated": 1677436586, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133686050": {"recommendationid": "133686050", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965283193", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2326, "playtime_at_review": 4819, "last_played": 1677436861}, "language": "english", "review": "I am really enjoying the story and the game play.", "timestamp_created": 1677436389, "timestamp_updated": 1677436389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133686014": {"recommendationid": "133686014", "author": {"steamid": "76561199035622277", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 820, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 820, "playtime_at_review": 790, "last_played": 1677438180}, "language": "english", "review": "Excessive fun", "timestamp_created": 1677436364, "timestamp_updated": 1677436364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133685992": {"recommendationid": "133685992", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960924747", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 479, "playtime_at_review": 1154, "last_played": 1677435975}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, combat reminds me of Fable which is a favorite of mine.", "timestamp_created": 1677436345, "timestamp_updated": 1677436345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133685928": {"recommendationid": "133685928", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993168707", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 2641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1748, "playtime_at_review": 2641, "last_played": 1677436151}, "language": "english", "review": "NOSTALGIA AT ITS FINEST !\n\nHarry Potter fans rejoice, this is the game we have all been waiting for.

That means you only get to pick up 13 pieces of gear before you have to sell. They give you a destroy option so you can deprive yourself of gold in a game where everything you need for quests/items is super expensive. There's not a lot of options to earn gold either.\n\nI wanted the Chinese Chomping Cabbage but there's literally no way to grow them until you are almost ~10-15hrs into the game despite them being introduced to the player around the 2-4 hrs mark. \n\nReally wish they had the spell slots open at the start of the game. Having to spend talent points for a basic feature is disgusting. Since you don't have a lot of spells early game this isn't that bad, if I only had one more bar at the start I wouldn't be complaining. As it is I have to swap out spells if I want to do well in combat early game, punishing me for daring to use the stealth spell that was given to me to start combat. \n\nLoved the appearance system, especially since the gear is freakish to comical. I came from playing LotRO to this so I felt right at home. Really wish they had an appearance set option, as it is everytime I equip gear I have to set the appearance again. This is doubled by the annoyance that the gear is so wild, I briefly get to see my beloved character look like a clown.\n\nBesides these gripes, the game captures the spirit of movies down to the details. Combat is snappy, enemies remain a threat despite the power of the player character. Love how the melee enemies like Goblin Assassin can close in on you so quickly, allows a lot of player response. \n\nPlaying on hard everything seems to four shot me, but I'm almost never using healing pots because of the after combat health regen, and combat ends pretty quickly either way at least in early game.", "timestamp_created": 1677434415, "timestamp_updated": 1677434415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133683819": {"recommendationid": "133683819", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326584159", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3514, "playtime_at_review": 3514, "last_played": 1677323720}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1677434404, "timestamp_updated": 1677434404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133683616": {"recommendationid": "133683616", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060188117", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1898, "playtime_at_review": 1891, "last_played": 1677436438}, "language": "english", "review": "The story and exploration of this game is whimsical and fun.

In fact, I'm glad I did because I want to do everything possible to support the creation of games with this level of quality. I give Hogwarts Legacy 92 / 100 for the following reasons:\n\nWhat I liked:\n1. The graphics and world detail - this is right up there with Witcher 3, Cyberpunk, Mass Effect and Dragon Age. You know how I judge when a world is A+ quality? When I frequently don't fast travel to locations even though I've been there because I just want to enjoy the scenery. And you don't just get one world - you get four because it feels so different in each of the four seasons - incredible.\n2. The music - it's like being in a Harry Potter movie. And it's the best kind of game-soundtrack: you don't so much hear it as feel it. It's always present and enhancing the game without you even realizing it.\n3. The sheer amount of cool things to do: like all the open-world RPG greats, this one is full of rocks to turn over and there's always something interesting underneath.\n\nWhat I didn't like as much:\nFirst off there was nothing in this game I didn't like, but there were some things that made me take away points from House Avalanche:\n1. Some of the game elements felt a little shallow. I don't want to do spoilers but you'll see what I mean about 40 hours into the game. All the great A+ open-world RPGs fall victim to this - they try to do too much and then don't tie the loose ends together.\n2. The morality of dark magic / good magic leads to some rather ridiculous situations in combat - again no spoilers but you'll see what I mean. Nothing that detracts from the game it just makes you scratch your head, giggle at the absurdity, and it is immersion breaking.\n3. I wish there was a bit more variety of enemies - but this is something they'll expand with DLC I'm sure.\n\nA great experience, one that made me forget my life and stay up too late several times. Only the best games do that.

It has the magical dream of walking through Hogwarts Castle at your own pace and not having to follow what the books and movies do. \n\nPros:\n- I certainly enjoy the little details in the world and the references to the HP saga. I was walking quietly (or maybe not quietly) in all the Hogwarts and Hogsmeade corners.\n- One of the best battle systems I've ever seen in an action game.\n- An engaging story with lots of rich and exciting characters.\n\nCons:\n- Not much real reason to play with other houses, besides looking at the different common rooms (which are beautifully designed). Only one big mission at the start makes the difference between houses.\n- Lack of content at the end.

It provided an immersive world that is a dream for any Harry Potter Fan. The game excelled more than it failed in many retrospects. I beat the campaign and have 38 Hours in the game. Here is my perspective.\n\nSuccesses of the game:\n\n1. Immersion. Any building is possible to enter, loading screens are minimal, and everything flows extremely well in the world. I felt like I was in the Harry Potter Universe the whole time playing this.\n\n2. The magic system. The way you fight with magic in this game, and interact with the world while using it is amusing and exciting at the  same time. The combat with magic had me on the edge of my seat throughout fighting the various monsters of the world, and the puzzles I had to use my magic on provided entertainment. \n\n3. Flying. This game did an amazing job with flying mounts and flying on your broom. I enjoyed flying around Hogwarts and seeing the size of the world in this game (it is huge)\n\n4. Character development. The story of this game does an amazing job making you develop relationships with the characters you see that play a big role in the excitement of the game. Personally my favorite characters I became fond of playing this game were Sebastian Sallow and Natsai Onai. \n\n5. Lore. This game's' biggest strength without a doubt is lore. You see so many creatures described in JK Rowling's films, you see paintings on the walls described exactly like in the Harry Potter books, and you overall can tell the makers of this game took a lot of time to describe the Harry Potter Universe properly.\n\nFailures of the game (although the game is far more of a success than failure):\n\n1. Empty, but beautiful world. The world in this game is huge (which is another pro) but it is extremely empty outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. Some areas had me wishing the developers spent more time adding details. The Forbidden Forest especially could have been WAY better. The world still maintains beauty but is very empty.\n\n2. Slow narration. The start of the game is extremely slow, and it takes a while to get off your feet. Some parts had me thinking that characters were just providing filler in their narration. Some narration was also very boring and had me trying to skim over it as soon as I could.\n\n3. Repetitive monsters/beasts. This game has a very enjoyable combat system and I also really enjoyed the aspect of taming beasts, but a lot of the monsters and beasts you interacted with were repetitive. You mostly only fight wolves, knights (pensieves), goblins, poachers, spiders, trolls, ashwinders, dugbogs, thieves, or inferiuses (zombies). For beasts you have like 6 you can capture and put in a habitat and nothing further. \n\n4. Side quests versus the main story. I wanted to start the game doing a lot of side quests but had to do the story because if I didn't I would not have all of the mechanics of the game unlocked (especially lockpicking. You don't get it until later in the main story when you should get it early on). The game pressures you to focus purely on the main story and getting it complete rather than doing any side quests which I think is a negative in a game trying to be free and open world. \n\n5. A game that missed out on a lot of potential in certain aspects. You pick a house when you begin the game, but the house you pick barely affects the plot of the game. I would have liked to have seen houses play a bigger role in the game. You also cannot do much in your house area. Throughout the game, they claim you can customize your character's gear in a unique fashion (including your wand), but the appearance of gear is extremely repetitive. Your wand customization is minimal, although it does exist which is nice. \n\nOverall, this game excelled in so many aspects of detail. It's biggest strength in my opinion is immersion and lore. This is the perfect game for a Harry Potter fan. Some points had me wish it went further with care for detail (especially when it comes to repetition of characters, clothes, etc), but it is an extremely great game. I would give it an 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1677429512, "timestamp_updated": 1677429512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133678326": {"recommendationid": "133678326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198849984227", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 925, "playtime_at_review": 876, "last_played": 1677432350}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing continuation of the harry potter story!", "timestamp_created": 1677429456, "timestamp_updated": 1677429456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133678215": {"recommendationid": "133678215", "author": {"steamid": "76561199092852420", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 454, "playtime_at_review": 507, "last_played": 1677436398}, "language": "english", "review": "fun yes :)", "timestamp_created": 1677429363, "timestamp_updated": 1677429363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133678019": {"recommendationid": "133678019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113866632", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2391, "playtime_at_review": 3124, "last_played": 1677429627}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing.

It was a little \"small\" content wise to be a 10/10, compared to other games like Cyberpunk 2077 (played over 200 hours in with no DLC) and Witcher 3 (played over 300 hours including DLC). Part of the reason is also that there is relatively little replayability (a NG+ mode would be good to have).\n\nI finished the Hogwarts Legacy main story in about 37 hours on Normal difficulty (was not rushing as I had reached level 38 out of 40 by then, and had spent several hours messing around in the Room of Requirement). It took another few hours to finish off all the in-game Collections and Challenges, and I had 100% Achievements after 44 hours on one character (not counting the additional 3 Achievements for which you need to complete a specific quest while playing a character in each house). This is on par with other single player RPGs I played such as Jedi: Fallen Order and Horizon Zero Dawn.\n\nI enjoyed the story and thought it was good for the target Harry Potter audience. It is not revolutionary, and it's fairly easy to predict exactly how everything will play out. But it is well written with good voice acting, and scratches the nostalgia itch for fans of the IP. Combat and overall gameplay was responsive and fun. Some people are disappointed it's not a full blown simulation game, where you eat, sleep, and go the bathroom in between attending classes repeatedly. I think that would have been boring, and is not in the spirit of the original franchise. You see glimpses of routine school life, but that's all going on behind the scenes. We only saw Harry spending a fraction of his time \"doing school\" and Hogwarts Legacy is the same.\n\nPerformance was perfectly fine for me. I play at 1440p with a RTX 3070, Ryzen 5 3600, 32gb RAM, on an M.2 SSD. Settings a mix of High and Ultra, Quality DLSS, RT Off. I averaged around 70-80 fps with no significant dips or stuttering. The most annoying things were the occasional loading pauses when opening doors in Hogwarts, and items/characters loading slowly when entering a new area. This often happened when teleporting into Hogsmeade and running into invisible NPCs on the street who hadn't loaded yet. Neither of those should be happening to the extent that they are.

It really does. What Hogwarts Legacy gives you is a large game, with a huge map to explore, and exploration really pays off. There's challenges all around the map, and just exploring Hogwarts alone is just fun. There's things to find everywhere in the castle, so much in fact that it's worth opening up every toilet stall.\nThe storyline is interesting, as are the side quests, the visuals are stunning, the music is lovely.\n\nWarning: the following part contains spoilers.\n\nYou can tell that the makers were familiar with the movies and the novels, and they know how to cater to fans. There's nice little easter eggs, such as what happens to the humming suit of armor, or students getting screamers. And also just fan service, such as getting sorted into a house or what happens when you get your own wand.\n\nI like the fact that you can customize your clothing however you like. You'll be able to use the look of every clothing item you ever found, even if you sell the actual item. So that's nice. There's also clothing items that have no other purpose than being cosmetic.\n\nSadly, the game is not without its fails. For one thing, the character you play is rather flat and one-dimensional. Always friendly and polite, even the way they habitually fold their hands. You get no background on them, and they have little in the way of personality at all. Even their way of speaking is pretty much always the same, no matter the situation. Being admitted as a fifth year student, you're apparently able to catch up  to your peers in little to no time (either that or the curriculum in Hogwarts is rather meager). You're also some kind of wunderkind who is able to basically not only master every skill first try, but also excell in it.\n\nI mentioned that I like than you can change the look of every item of clothing. However, it can be a bit frustrating if you finish a challenge that takes a long time to complete (looking at you, daedalian keys!) and all you get is a special cosmetic item. Most of these challenges are, of course, optional, but there's one or two such challenges that you want to complete in order to gain access to more parts of the game (literally).\n\nIt would also be nice if the wand had more meaning. Sure, it's customizeable, but it's purely cosmetic. It would be nice if you could modify your wand to, for example, be stronger at destruction skills, or cause more damage with force skills, stuff like that.\nThe spells themselves are okay, but the spell slots are annoying. You get way more spells than you can equip at the same time. Especially since interacting with beasts or spells used solely for puzzle solving also take up spell slots. Even with the 16 slots you get in the end, I found myself constantly switching out spells. Maybe the devs introduce some sort of spell mode switch at some point, allowing to switch between damage slots and utility slots.\n\nYour house doesn't really matter either, it only changes up a few dialogs a bit and slightly alters one or two quests.\n\nAlso, and that is a big shame, there is very little replay value. The story, as well as all the side quests, are almost completely linear. Your decisions simply do not matter and have very little to no effect on the game (other than perhaps a certain character being available or not, or learning an optional spell or not). Wether you choose to be nice and helpful, demand additonal rewards, keep stuff you're supposed to retrieve, support someone or refuse to do so, it doesn't matter. Even learning and using unforgivable curses has no consequences.\nIn fact, one of the biggest differences you'll get to experience is the comments enemies during battle, as they change depending on your tactics. Frequently use dark magic in battle? Like to throw militant vegetables at your opponents? They actually change their taunts according to that.\n\nAlso, I have to mention this, even though I'm not sure what to think of it. The game plays some time in the 18th to 19th century, so over 100 or even close to 200 years ago. I don't know what Great Britain looked like back then, but apparently the wizard society was rather... inclusive back then. Certainly more inclusive than muggle society at the time.\n\nStill, the game is certainly a must-have for every Harry Potter fan, especially considering that the other games of the franchise, which were based on the novels or movies, well... they're a category in itself.", "timestamp_created": 1677428040, "timestamp_updated": 1677428040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133676671": {"recommendationid": "133676671", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974038519", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 883, "playtime_at_review": 939, "last_played": 1677436432}, "language": "english", "review": "To be clear, this game is getting a positive review despite some significant performance issues still present.

There's a lot to do, and much to explore in the open world that the game provides; the graphics of the game are beautiful, and I commonly found myself sitting in the air upon my broom and gazing out over the Highlands. \n\nHowever, while this game is almost perfect, there are still a few things that I'm not a fan of. To make things easy, I'll compile a full summary of my opinion in a list below -\n\nPros:\n- Easily navigable menu system with efficiently-done tutorials and helpful pop-ups when needed.\n\n- Combat is easy to learn, though somewhat hard to master, to an extent. Stringing spells isn't difficult, but timing the switching of sets can be a bit distracting.\n\n- Hogwarts itself and the characters within, as well as around, in all the hamlets and down to the coast, are quite alive and feel like actual people. While you can still tell it's a game, they aren't badly done and are what you'd expect of the Potterverse.\n\n- Utility of spells, potions and herbology items is well-balanced and smooth; large variety of spells too, making for a relatively expansive capability for different builds.\n\n- The open world is expansive, and flying around it is extremely fun; another note on flying, too - while it is fun, the broom can be quite stiff on the controls sometimes. This isn't much of a problem though.\n\n- Overall enjoyable game, and definitely replayable if you're the sort who enjoys seeing things again and noticing new things about them, such as foreshadowing, or if you'd just like to experience the magic of Hogwarts Legacy once again. \n\nCons:\n- Horribly optimised for PC, required me to do extensive modifications to game files as well as switch the graphics API in order to just stop the game from freezing. Extreme stuttering and lag upon first start, but after playing for about 5-10 minutes, it alleviates and the game actually becomes playable.\n-- ^ I've personally discovered this to be an issue with the game's rendering engine, and this should be fixed within the next few patches, if not the next one.\n\n- Excessive repetition in combat/ambient dialogue; while I understand NPCs are NPCs, hearing an Ashwinder go on about how I stole their Hippogriff or \"I'll get what I'm due\", in whatever fashion it's said, every single time I fight them is... boring, to say the least. Some more variety in the mid-fight trash talking would make things a bit nicer, and perhaps even some witty lines from the playable protagonist as they defeat enemies would've been a good inclusion too, as is done in the PlayStation Exclusive Spider-Man.\n\n- Deaths in the game can feel a bit... empty, and rushed. To avoid spoilers, I won't be mentioning any, but to say the least, prominent side characters who die aren't typically mourned for long, if at all. The game feels pretty remorseless, especially with how the protagonist can so easily learn Avada Kadavra - especially under the conditions it's learnt - and overall just takes away the empathetic bit that we're used to seeing in Harry Potter. \n\n- Seemingly high-tier enemies, such as Trolls, become fodder in face of the Three Unforgivable Curses. While I do know this makes sense, it would just still feel better if they were at least still a challenge - I mean, hell, you can Imperio a Troll and just spam it to death from there, and it can't do anything. \n\n- Usage of ancient and dark magic is weirdly... [i]normalised?[/i] While it's shown repetitively in the HP movies that any of the Three Unforgivable Curses [TUC] are not to be touched - such is their namesake - and users of said curses are typically evil or seen as such, they are very casually mentioned, used and taught throughout the course of the game. While there are some touches here and there, such as certain characters mentioning their dislike/support of you using a curse against enemies in combat, their comments are empty and meaningless, and there's no effect on morality with any of the protagonist's friends. Furthermore, the TUC are heavily frowned upon for their harmful nature while ancient magic is casually brandished by the protagonist to... explode people into what seems to be pure magic, slam people into the ground thrice in one go, summon lightning bolts that eviscerate people from existence and destroy them with fireballs that send them soaring meters back - and, as evidently shown by the protagonist's monologues thereafter, said ancient magic attacks [b]kill[/b] these enemies.\nSo... if Avada Kadavra is so heavily guarded, kept secret and frowned upon when used due to being an instant-kill technique, then why can the protagonist of this game so casually use their ancient magic - an extremely overpowered, unique and rare ability - on literally any enemy they face, no matter who they're with? There's no sense in this, considering the ancient magic is basically doing the same as the TUC, but to an even more brutal extent. \n-- I do understand this is mostly for the sake of epic gameplay things, but there's still the fact that it's extremely nonsensical, especially considering the importance of the curses and even more-so Avada Kadavra.\n\n[h1]My Overall Opinion[/h1]\n\nWhile I don't think anyone has stuck around for this excessively long review, if you have, thanks! Or if you just skipped to the end for the TL;DR, that works too.\n\n[b]Hogwarts Legacy, in my opinion, is a good stepping stone for the studio behind it to set up something more well-thought out, detailed and... for lack of better word, richer. They did an amazingly good job with this game, and I find myself getting lost in the visuals, exploration, combat and social scenarios that the game has to offer, and I don't believe that my problems with the game are intolerable. They're able to be ignored, to an extent, though when I find the game is a bit lacking in certain areas, I'm usually already dealing with something new and have forgotten about my problem from before. Overall, if you're a fan of large areas to explore, interesting things to see, callbacks and references to canon material, beautiful visuals, fast-paced and ragdoll-esque combat and would enjoy a fresh take on the Potterverse, this game is for you. Otherwise, even if you just enjoy RPG games with fluid combat, open areas and fun exploration, this game is also for you.[/b]\n\n[u]I, personally, give this game a solid 8.5/10.[/u]", "timestamp_created": 1677427765, "timestamp_updated": 1677427765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133676355": {"recommendationid": "133676355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081688336", "num_games_owned": 500, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 2201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2023, "playtime_at_review": 2201, "last_played": 1677410462}, "language": "english", "review": "Really nice game that gives any harry potter fan a proper wizarding world experience.

From the moment I started playing, I was blown away by the game's visuals - the attention to detail is truly stunning, and it really feels like you are exploring the magical world of Hogwarts.\n\nBut it's not just the visuals that impressed me - the story is equally captivating, and I found myself fully invested in the world and characters of the game. What really sets Hogwarts Legacy apart, though, is the way that small tasks and quests are seamlessly woven into the story progression. I usually find these kinds of tasks to be tedious, but in this game, I actually enjoyed doing them - they added depth and richness to the world and helped to flesh out the characters and story.\n\nOne of the things that really stands out about Hogwarts Legacy is the passion and love that the developers clearly have for the source material. This is a game that was clearly made by people who care deeply about the Harry Potter universe, and that passion shines through in every aspect of the game. The attention to detail, the lovingly crafted environments, and the richly developed characters are all a testament to the developers' dedication and love for the world of Harry Potter.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend Hogwarts Legacy highly enough. It's a truly remarkable game that manages to capture the essence of the Harry Potter universe in a way that few other games have been able to do. If you're a fan of the series, or just love immersive, story-driven games, then this one should definitely be on your must-play list.

I'm not going to go in to it, suffice to say, google it yourself and decide if you want to boycott or purchase this title.\n\nThis is probably the most enjoyable 6/10 title (by this I mean that it's a heavily flawed game, no objective numeric x/y score exists) I've ever played. The game has some major flaws, the writing being inconsistent, at times lazy and a lot of plot elements suffers heavily from \"idiot plot\". The game also loves giving you the illusion of choice, but in actuality it's more the case of \"do this with a smile\", \"do this but snark and demand money the entire way through\". Most of the side-quests are glorified delivery / fetchquests. The story is also poorly paced, frontloading the mainquest plotpoints then forgetting them for the midpart of the game, only for needing to speedrun the last points for the climactic finale. There are some RPG elements that feel forced into the game because that's what other open world systems have. While the levling system works as a guide, encouraging you to keep within level appropriate zones, the gear and gear-improvement system feels vestigial. The gear system basically boils down to bigger number better and the upgrade system merely exists to justify the pokemon esque catch em all type of activities. The flying controls also feels very clunky, basically your character exists on a set plane and you're not as much navigating a 3 dimensional area as you're navigating through a 2d area with more accessible through increasing/decreasing your height.\n\n*But* I could not put this game down. It does the HP-verse justice by having the same feeling of wonder and wimsy around it. Having to go to class to learn spells, some homework assignments for you to do before learning the next spell, Hogwarts as a whole. All of it feels spot on. The collectibles that litter the place feels more enjoyable to search out compared to any other open world in my recent memory. The combat feels fluid and punchy, and while it doesn't make much sense in universe the rock paper siccors type of shielding fits in well. The combat controls does feel a bit too \"console\" adapted, but I'd suggest rebinding some of the spellslots hotkeys to mouse4-5 (and other mousebuttons you may have) as I personally found the scrollwheel to be too easy to pick the wrong scrollslot.

It's fulfils that itch of being a wizard.\n- Riled up people on social media should not stop you playing this game if you really want to.\n- All the complaints I have about this game are minuscule, like the removal of Quidditch.\n- Never the less, I think they will probably add Quidditch in DLC, then we will have the complete package!\n- So let's go over some of the things I like and the minor inconveniences the game, first the negatives:\n\n- We have all probably noticed, the game lags at higher graphics, even on good systems, why is this?\n- Over all my searching, it seems like there is severe memory leak issues with this game.\n- More over, there are some backend bugs due to how the source code was implemented into the game.\n- Everything you can do to limit this won't fix that, you need Ascendio mod to have a chance to fix it.\n- Not sure if this will be fixed in future, but if you are fine with mods, there is at least a good fix for it.\n\n- As for gameplay itself, I wish you could reset talents, also I hope we get an increase in spell variety.\n- Really, the gameplay is fine, very fluid, could do with some touch ups in dodge indicators, seen it bug a bit.\n- Evil characters wont have THAT much consequences either, like Avada Kedavra is just like saying a swear.\n\n- Not seen much bugs, I did fall through the floor once which was weird, it didn't let me open my map either.\n- On top of that, sometimes rolling and climbing are a bit... inconsistent, you can end up in unintended places.\n- Take the Witches Tomb, there is a platform you can climb up, only a specific angle.... for some reason...???\n\n- Bugs and weird gameplay aside. They seem fairly minimal, let's talk about the forced \"representation\":\n- Every dialogue option refers to you as \"They\", I get it's due to 'modern times' but it feels very out of place.\n- In some dialogue it just doesn't flow well, it's like they intended the dialogue to have he/him and she/her.\n- Now I don't mind if they was an option, but the other two options should also be a thing.\n- Guess they wanted to avoid drama from the mob, at that point, was just a futile effort, same with Sirona.\n\n- Kindness and empathy may be the intention of the developers, but it just comes off as pandery after a while.\n- I do admit though, these interactions are not that bad and are far between. Doesn't impede the game really.\n- Let's talk about the unforgivables: OP, not as OP as you think. You will run Avada Kedevra all the time.\n- Learning new spells sometimes is a waste since you wont use them but more variety is always good tbh.\n- Every spell has a use but some overlap. I wish the Room of Requirements spells didn't need to be hot barred.\n- Difficulty is pretty decent, but you could go through this entire game without being hit once I think.\n\n- Oh also forgot, the stealth system is a bit  bare boned but it's also not the worst, needs expanding to be sure.\n- Very nearly every situation can be overcame with brute force, there are small required stealth parts tho.\n- Even then, these are scripted parts, not something you would naturally use in the open world as much.\n- Really... overall, these are BARELY nitpicks at all.\n\n- The combat is excellent and so many combos, load outs and rotations I've seen on youtube.\n- Hitting people with certain spells feels so punchy. The fantasy is there for being a truly powerful wizard.\n- I personally like to use expelliarmus to disarm opponents then use Magic to throw their weapons at them.\n- Sound is also great, every spell has a unique feel and puts you into that fantasy of being a wizard so well.\n\n- Game of the year contender to be sure. Though I suppose it isn't all that revolutionary, it's just plain fun.\n- Another open world game, but at least this time, you have a true feeling of fantasy and role play.\n- Minus some of the forced dialogue, the script for the game ain't bad, funny moments too with students.\n- Every npc seems to have some trigger that makes them say something at certain times or do something.\n\n- To me as well, the characters are great, already seeing people thirst over the Herbology teacher, jeez lmao.\n- Overall the charecterization of each house is spot on, I love the clothing, the areas and the students designs.\n- Until they allow Quidditch or house points, this can be expanded on, it's mostly cosmetic at the moment.\n- Common rooms too look nice, not any customization there, but that is what the room of requirement is for.\n- Hufflepuff has the best Jackdaw mission btw, they go to a very well known place in the wizarding world.\n\n- Great game.\n- Reccomend to anyone who loves the wizarding world.\n- All the things you expect are here, not rocking the boat but what we need right now.\n- Salazar.\n- Slytherin.\n\n[spoiler]Revelio[spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1677421124, "timestamp_updated": 1677421354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538043498992919922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133668556": {"recommendationid": "133668556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178920010", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 817, "playtime_at_review": 817, "last_played": 1677421073}, "language": "english", "review": "solid", "timestamp_created": 1677421079, "timestamp_updated": 1677421079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133668398": {"recommendationid": "133668398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062878726", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1534, "playtime_at_review": 1790, "last_played": 1677421180}, "language": "english", "review": "great game.", "timestamp_created": 1677420963, "timestamp_updated": 1677420963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133668037": {"recommendationid": "133668037", "author": {"steamid": "76561199173466943", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 802, "playtime_at_review": 2044, "last_played": 1677430644}, "language": "english", "review": "Good", "timestamp_created": 1677420635, "timestamp_updated": 1677420635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133667962": {"recommendationid": "133667962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066508410", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 199, "playtime_at_review": 180, "last_played": 1677431707}, "language": "english", "review": "yo", "timestamp_created": 1677420570, "timestamp_updated": 1677420570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133667944": {"recommendationid": "133667944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362151209", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2871, "playtime_at_review": 3452, "last_played": 1677436817}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are a Potterhead, how can you not play this game?

Are you a harry potter fan? Or atleast have some love for the world this game is set in. Then this game will not disappoint. The environments in this game faithfully recreate the wizarding world with few exceptions. Such as the forbidden forest being in the completely wrong place.\n\nAs a long time harry potter fan I do have some criticism on some of the choices. The story itself is a bit simple and leaves a lot to be desired. Personally I would have liked something more grounded, but this game just had to go with the chosen-one ancient magic gimmick that gets old pretty quickly. It also doesnt seem plausible to me that all these huge ancient magic structures are just forgotten about after this time period. The ancient magic dungeons make hogwarts look like a pretty stupid building in comparison.\n\nThe story itself however is acceptable though disappointing in some ways. It seemed the developers wanted to include some choices in your playthrough. And included things like unforgivable curses and allowed you to be a bit of an asshole in dialogues. But I feel they shouldve left these out. They don't make sense to me. If you are going to include evil choices in your game then let my character be evil and dont switch my character to talking like goodie two shoes five minutes later.\n\nThe characters aren't quite there. They're just.. not that interesting. Harry potter is a series about friendships with other characters. And they certainly tried to accomplish it by having a few students with specific questlines which you become friends with. The problem however, is that outside of these questlines you never interact with them, they never accompany you, they never interact with each other either. I think I read a lot of people say the same. This game feels a bit lonely. Despite this there are some shining stars. The sebastian/ominis questline having the strongest characters by far.\n\nThe world itself also doesnt make you quite feel connected to it. It's like you are a ghost walking through hogwarts but no one can actually see you. When night time comes the castle is mostly deserted and prefects dont even come after you anymore. Even during cutscenes you will find the great hall only with a handful of students.\n\nThe audio is probably this games biggest sin. No hate towards the voice actors, I am sure they tried. But nothing killed the excitement for my own wizard character more than the voice performance. I couldn't stand the voice acting on him. (i dont know how the female one sounds) and then the pitch correction just makes your voice sound metallic likely because they use a broken in game filter. The sound design itself is pretty good, but the voices, the dialogue just has not been done well at all. A lack of integration. it feels like the voices are just put straight into the game out of a studio.\n\nThis game also cannot help but to fall into the trap of countless open world games. They create a certain gameplay loop. Puzzles, bandit camps, you name it. But then overdo it. I cannot tell you how many times I found the EXACT same treasure vault in different places around the world. Or the IDENTICAL puzzle I had to do again and again. Whilst yes, a lot of this is skippable. Why do game devs keep doing this? Quality over quantity. This game couldve done by cutting down the map size 3 times over. The further south you go the less interesting it becomes.\n\nDespite all these criticisms this game is worth it in 2 cases in my opinion:\n1. You are a harry potter fan and love the world of HP\n2. You like standard run of the mill open world games\n\nThis game is no more special than any other open world game I've played. A 30 hour or so main story+side quests with 10-20 hours of filler.

If you are not a fan, I imagine it might be hit or miss. \n\nThe open world is quite vast and not limited to Hogwarts and close areas - I was honestly quite shocked when I saw the size of the map. You get your broom to fly around fairly early so I imagine it had to be huge to make it feel big enough for it. It is full of points of interest that give you stuff to do there, most of it however I felt was uninspired and mostly the typical open world \"map puke\" padding. I understand they needed wider world to make some quests and not making all center just around Hogwarts, but on the other hand I'd bu quite OK to just have Hogwarts, Hogsmead, Forbidden Forest and surrounding areas accessible and still think of it as big enough.\n\nMain story is.... okay. For me the side quests were the stars, especially those centered around my classmates and which I'd call \"main side quests\". There are your filler side quests there too, but the questlines where you develop friendships with other Hogwarts students, alongside the \"quests\" that simulate classes to learn new spells are very well done and simulate the Hogwarts feeling perfectly.\n\nTalking of spells: there. Is. So. Many! And it's great balance too - some from books, some from movies and there is even Flipendo for those who remember the now ancient Harry Potter movie tie-in games.

I would put combat into clunky, but OK.\n2. Story, the story drags and that's a real bad thing because the magic of Hogwarts is diminished at every hour past 25-30. The story and how it plays out is as clunky as the combat, a lot of back and forth completing inane side missions to proceed with the main story line.\n3. NPC story lines, I never felt anything or any connection with them, they're forced on the character and you go through it like a hamster runs on the hamster wheel.\n4. Travel is good, they have fast travel, beasts and brooms.\n5. The upgrade system is medicore, I never felt more powerful with any of the upgrades.\n6. The room of requirement and beast collection side game was just a time wasting chore.\n7. I chose to have may character not learn unforgivable curses, this had no effect to my knowledge on reactions, how people treat you or ending.\n8. Due to the length of clunky story a lot of the fighting, discovery, Merlin trials all become either mundane rote, or just not worthy of your time. Killing the same thing for the nth time has no capture by the middle of the game.\n\nGamers could be forgiven to play about 30 hours of this game and drop it, which I assume a lot would.\n\nIt really needed the Rockstar's Bully element to have enough edge to make it a unforgettable game. You're in  what amounts to private(public in the UK) high school in England and yet none of those tropes were examined, which is a missed opportunity for immersion, replayability and general world building.\n\nWhy I do recommend this game, even with its issues, is that Hogwarts art and design are so good that it alone is worth a play, but definitely get it on a massive sale.

As a Potter fan this is a must play, the game you've been waiting for!\n\nThe best thing about the game is 100% the world, a great open world with lots of things to do. Each area has it's own unique feeling, from the spooky atmosphere of the forbidden forest to the open, airy feeling of the southern coast. Hogsmeade is a delightful wizard village, brimming with life and Hogwarts itself? Oh my..\n\nWhat they did with Hogwarts is nothing short of amazing, it's so big and detailed, every room is different and there are secrets everywhere. 30 Hours into the game I was still finding parts of the castle I hadn't discovered yet. Truly a labour of love of the developers, it shows. Not even speaking about how they did all this without any loading screens!\n\nThe combat is fluid and easy to learn, reminding me a lot of the arkham combat system. It also provides a lot of variation with the 30+ different spells you can use. There's also a stealth system if one would want to go that route but I find that it is quite basic.\n\nThe main story is nothing amazing but still very enjoyable, the characters are all really likeable and you really feel like a student in the wizarding school. But the game's story really shines in the side quests, some of the 'relationship questlines' are really memorable. \n\nTLDR, this game is a dream come true for every Potter fan, a game made with a lot of love by developers who really care and it shows. And for people who are not really fans of the franchise can still find a lot of enjoyment in this solid made game.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1677411094, "timestamp_updated": 1677411094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133657818": {"recommendationid": "133657818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186279939", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2574, "playtime_at_review": 4162, "last_played": 1677414962}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice", "timestamp_created": 1677410941, "timestamp_updated": 1677410941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133657802": {"recommendationid": "133657802", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086770714", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 884, "playtime_at_review": 884, "last_played": 1677391704}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy it, no bugs, great gameplay, you get to use a stick to kill things and you have much of the funs. you can also ride a broom instead of using it to clean things. someone someone needs to make a movie about this game like that did with the Uncharted series on from Playstation.", "timestamp_created": 1677410917, "timestamp_updated": 1677410917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133657650": {"recommendationid": "133657650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198837010514", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 440, "playtime_at_review": 440, "last_played": 1677410511}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolute Masterpiece", "timestamp_created": 1677410738, "timestamp_updated": 1677410738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133657644": {"recommendationid": "133657644", "author": {"steamid": "76561199042494506", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 221, "playtime_at_review": 221, "last_played": 1677410647}, "language": "english", "review": "great combat, engaging from the opening scene, amazing graphic and sound design, great story line and world building\n", "timestamp_created": 1677410731, "timestamp_updated": 1677410731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133657511": {"recommendationid": "133657511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079736408", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2809, "playtime_at_review": 2850, "last_played": 1677438049}, "language": "english", "review": "fun", "timestamp_created": 1677410571, "timestamp_updated": 1677410571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133657392": {"recommendationid": "133657392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198948024551", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1544, "playtime_at_review": 1343, "last_played": 1677429501}, "language": "english", "review": "niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee", "timestamp_created": 1677410446, "timestamp_updated": 1677410446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133657062": {"recommendationid": "133657062", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044665016", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4903, "playtime_at_review": 5340, "last_played": 1677409562}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS is how you make a near perfect game out of an established franchise.

I'm not a fan of real life politics getting shoehorned into games, so the lgbt stuff in it did take me out of the game, but it wasn't super prevalent, or shoved in my face so I was able to ignore what there was.\nI'm fine with politics as long as it is part of the story and lore. The Dragon Age franchise nailed that part of their games.\nEverything else about this game is incredible. My computer hits the minimum requirements, unfortunately, but even then it still looks great. The spells are fun to use, the door puzzles really had me stumped until I sat down for an hour and figured them out, only to find a sort of 'cheat sheet' not long after.\n\nThe combat is fun, but there is a bit of clunkiness to it. I think they intended for all of the defensive abilities, the shield and the roll, to be used together, but they made it so the roll was usable for everything and the shield only usable with the basic enemies. Mini bosses and some more advanced enemies can totally ignore your shield and wreck your whole existence.\nIf you do a spell set to blow through the shields of every color, you can just roly poly through everything and wreck everything. If you're stubborn, like me, you could stupefy through any shield and use whatever spell you want. Problem is, I'm not always ready to roll and I get smacked around a bit. The lag doesn't help. I could get destroyed in a slideshow fight only to respawn and the fight runs perfectly and I get through it without a scratch. Just some issues with performance. \n\nInventory space isn't great either. I have upgraded my inventory a couple times, so it isn't asbad anymore, but for the first 10 hours I played the game after the tutorial/prologue stuff I probably spent at least one hour at hogsmeade selling crap because I couldn't hold more than one pound worth of clothing (slight exaggeration)\n\nI was initially a little disappointed by the character customization. I had hoped for a little more freedom with it, something like Elden Ring or Dragon Age Inquisition and it ended up being more like Monster Hunter World. Not that MHW is bad. I have around 400 hours in MHW so I can live with a similar character creation. I did love the wand creation though. I was able to find a design I liked and even themed it. I also found a beautiful handle for it early on and have stuck with it since.\n\nI'm also a huge fan of the Victorian Era style of the clothes. I know it takes place during that time, but I found myself thinking many times \"Oh this look old fashioned and really cool...Oh wait, it's actually the style of the time this takes place in\" \nI'm not sure that's actually a good thing now that I think on it. If it takes place in Victorian England and I have to remind myself of that when I'm looking at the clothes, I think they might have done too many of the clothes too modern for the time.\n\nIt is a great game, it's holding my attention and I'm already planning a second playthrough and I'm not even to the second trial yet.", "timestamp_created": 1677406986, "timestamp_updated": 1677411847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133654283": {"recommendationid": "133654283", "author": {"steamid": "76561199007846572", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4209, "playtime_at_review": 5174, "last_played": 1677406870}, "language": "english", "review": "I thought the game play was as good as Witcher 3.", "timestamp_created": 1677406972, "timestamp_updated": 1677406972, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133654218": {"recommendationid": "133654218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065040690", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 310, "playtime_at_review": 219, "last_played": 1677436481}, "language": "english", "review": "It GOOOOOOD", "timestamp_created": 1677406903, "timestamp_updated": 1677406903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133654163": {"recommendationid": "133654163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262270258", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4508, "playtime_at_review": 5700, "last_played": 1677414083}, "language": "english", "review": "Well that was the fastest 10 hours of my life...wait 100!?

So when I say to immediately buy one I don't do so lightly. This is the first case of me getting excited for a game and not being let down, with my hopes and expectations actually being exceeded entirely.\n\nPros:\n- The setting, world, details, rules, and general function of everything on a lore level mesh beautifully\n- The music is fantastic, changing between quest moments to flying to combat seamlessly to match every given moment\n- The combat is incredibly fun, almost as if someone on the team said \"What if our wizard was a gunslinger?\"\n- The exploration of the world as a whole is generally incredibly charming, streamlined by multiple forms of travel and interactive objects and challenges at nearly every turn. The world is packed with content.\n- Unraveling the mystery behind the motives of the protagonists and antagonist of the story is interesting and keeps you wanting more\n- The primary side characters and their plotlines are interesting and moving, albeit sometimes inconsistent\n\nCons:\n- Collection activities and achievements are tedious. Merlin trials are the prime example, being repetitive and time-consuming to complete for their achievement, with about two dozen needing to be completed after getting the final unlock from their completions in order to get that achievement. Ancient magic challenges are similar in this regard, requiring more effort with less to complete.\n- The writing gets slightly shaky at the end of the main quests, with characters who haven't shown prominence in the story showing up at the climax to help while the ones who did have prominence are nowhere to be found.\n- The choices you make don't make a particularly huge difference in the grand scheme of things. There are two diverging \"endings\" after the climax depending on your choice right before the final battle. Everything else isn't meaningful and characters don't do much other than offhandedly mention your accomplishments and actions in passing idle lines.\n- On the performance side of things: Frame dips are common, especially in Hogwarts itself and Hogsmeade. I experienced a single crash during a scene change in a quest, but none other than that. The game is stable overall, but the frame dips can be jarring.\n\nNeutrals:\n- It is incredibly easy to build your character into an unstoppable one-man magical army, especially when you have the perks for Crucio and Imperio unlocked. Avada Kedavra gets memed to death, but is acquired so late in the game that you're likely to already be annihilating legions of enemies with ease. Still, the game gives you that option - don't want to have to DoT, debuff, and burst down a big enemy in a few seconds? Have the instakill spell instead.\n- Certain aspects of the game are left almost intentionally open-ended. Quidditch is omitted from the game, an entire section of the Room of Requirement stays closed, and at least one companion story has an ambiguous future to it. This could be seen as a way for DLC to get added, or it could be seen as places where the devs fell short. I hope for the former.\n- The animations in dialogue are reused over and over and are almost always just you and the other NPC standing, never leaning or sitting.

You can run around casting as many unforgivable curses as you wish and there are no repercussions outside of a few comments made by your companions if you use them on companion quests. You'll also absolutely loathe some of your fellow students and want to be mean to them or see them continue to be \"villains\" but every character comes around to the good side eventually.\n\n- The Merlin trials (and the other puzzles for that matter) are quite frustrating and can be buggy. I've taken to always having my phone nearby to look up walkthroughs, which I don't particularly enjoy doing.\n\n- Glitches! Oh boy. The stuttering glitch was absolutely insane but there are ways to fix it, mainly by lowering your graphics settings. Also I really do recommend playing this with more than 16GB of RAM. It is an extremely taxing video game and while I do not identify as an attack helicopter my computer most certainly does. I have had to literally put my headphones on because of how loud the fan got. Might just be my hardware and I will be expanding my RAM.\n\n- You only have to deal with Prefects in the school twice and I think it would be a lot more fun if every night you had to deal with them and sneak around. It would help with the immersion a lot.\n\n- Again this may be just something on my end but your character's voice may sound like the lines were recorded in a tin can. \n\n- The spell slot system can be a bit weird to get used to at first but after a few hours of combat it feels very intuitive.\n\n- The skill tree really doesn't need to be invested into more than halfway, a lot of the perks are absolutely useless.\n\n- Oh, and don't plan on a 100% run any time soon. Several of the quests are glitched. However you do get to explore the world as much as you want after you finish the main quest so you will be able to go back into your save once those are patched.\n\nNow on to the positives!\n\n- The graphics are positively gorgeous. Even when I had to run on the lowest settings for a while, because of the stuttering issue, it was still a lovely experience.\n\n- Unlike what the keyboard warriors on Twitter will say, this game is incredibly diverse and trans friendly. Sirona is a delightful character and I wish we got to interact with her more. The controversy around her name is also very funny to me as well considering we make jokes about our names all the time or adapt a differently gendered version of our names. You can customize your character's gender expression, voice, and choose which dormitory they stay in. You are not bound to a binary system at all. Additionally, your character is referred to with gender neutral pronouns through the entire playthrough. And while your character obviously cannot engage in any romantic entanglements, you will run into the occasional queer character here and there who speaks highly of their partner. The people who criticize this game as somehow falling in line with JK Rowling's beliefs are absolutely insane.\n\n- Another note on what critics are saying: this is not \"literally a nazi simulator\". The goblins in this game do not take after Jewish people, there is no appropriation of Jewish culture that I could personally find, and this goblin rebellion does not revolve around a true liberation of the goblins or an equal rights movement. It revolves around Ranrok who is only using his followers for the purpose of gaining power for himself and he has cursed them and other creatures so that they will do his bidding. You will run into the occasional character who hates goblins but you will be able to sway their minds and get them to see reason. And, for the most part, the characters are not bigoted whatsoever. Of course, you will hear the occasional line going against mudbloods or half bloods but that's to be expected with Headmaster Black's reign. Also, there are rumors that mods in the official Discord are banning people for being Jewish but I have yet to find any real evidence of that. This controversy was 100% blown out of proportion.\n\n- The purchase of this game does not directly support JK Rowling either. She received a licensing fee but does not receive loyalties.\n\n- The combat is lots of fun and extremely challenging on higher difficulties. It is a bit funny though how you can run around murdering countless enemies with other spells but for some reason the Dark Arts are shunned.\n\n_ You can pet the cats.\n\n_ The beasts are so much fun and absolutely precious. I can't quite wrap my head around selling them for a profit even if the shopkeeper at Brood and Peck is rehoming them, though.\n\n- There are tons of easter eggs, hidden questions, trials/puzzles, and places for you to explore. Don't rush yourself because none of the quests expire. \n\n- It truly feels like you are living in the world of Harry Potter. I could have never asked for a better game. Flying around the castle feels so surreal and getting to walk through/explore all the areas we've seen in the movies has been an absolutely phenomenal experience. \n\nI cannot possibly list all of the positives here but please do not allow yourself to be bullied into not purchasing this game. I almost did. I have to hide the fact I am playing this game from everyone except one friend and my partner. This isn't even my main steam account. Being part of the LGBT/Jewish communities means that, sadly, JK Rowling's words and the words of her supporters do hurt. It also means that I have to rub shoulders with the people who give our community a bad name. On their behalf I am so sorry to anyone who may have been affected by their actions.\n\nHarry Potter was there for me growing up when no one else was. The books and movies were how I escaped the mental torment of a very abusive family. When I got to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, at Universal Studios Orlando, it was like a dream come true. Now this game brings me that same joy, that same escape, those same good feelings and good memories--except I can visit Hogwarts any time I want without paying an arm and a leg for plane tickets!\n\nOverall I give this game a 9 Puffles out of 10 Quaffles. I 100% recommend purchasing.", "timestamp_created": 1677402954, "timestamp_updated": 1677402954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1,

record: about half my playtime has been AFK.\n\nIt's a good game but it really overstays it's welcome. The enemy variety is limited and can become boring after you've fought spiders, poachers, goblins and dark wizards for the 100th time. Where is the creativity when it comes to enemy variety? you have over TWENTY years of lore to draw inspiration from.\n\nThe story is interesting but the character animations during cut scenes are stiff and wooden and the voice acting can be very dry at times. You could argue that this is a staple of open world games due to their sheer size and scope but Red Dead Redemption 2 came out almost five years ago...\n\nThe reason why I give this game a positive review is in it's exploration and combat. I've always wanted a Potterverse game of this scope ever since childhood so call it biased if you must.

I'd consider myself a distant observer, saw a couple of movies in the cinema back when they were released, but definitely not hugely knowleadgable about the lore and so on.

Yes, some of the mechanics are known from other major titles (like the Revelio mechanic revealing objects of interest in the player's proximity, just like in Assassin's Creed), and some of the combat and design cues feeling Souls-like, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, especially if the formula has worked so successfully. And, maybe, some of the characters' faces tend to look alike (like in Witcher 3, for example). But, all things considered, Hogwarts Legacy is a great feel-good kind of game that lets you do tons of fantasy roaming around and roleplaying as a Hogwarts student on your own. Plus, it's beautifully designed with so many varied places and objects to stop and marvel at, There's plenty of lessons to be learnt too for younger players if you are a parent. If I had children, I'd definitely let them play to their hearts' content. Lessons of tolerance, acceptance, assertiveness, and about being non-judgemental when it comes to differences.

The gamemechanics are smooth and easy to get into. Dont worry if you arent a diehard gamer, you'll do fine. The world will take you right back to the movies.\n\nI've only ever seen the movies, greatly enjoyed them as the story is fairly welldone. So I thought I'd try the game. Not a dissapointment. \nThe graphics are good, even on my now old 1080ti, playing on high. I do get the ocassional stutter but usually its smooth. The countryside looks great, the real beauty in the game however, is the castle itself with its different buildings with different styles. The room interiors are very detailed and furnished.\nCant say the same about houses in the countryside, those are rather small but not a big deal.\n\nThe combat in the game revolves entirely casting spells at targets you auto aim. It makes the action rather smooth and for someone who is used to manually aiming, its a bit easy at times. The challenge comes from specific enemies like trolls or if you are completely outnumbered.\nThe game has lots of puzzles that require the use of various spells. Most of these puzzles arent too difficult and your character will repeat hints(Wish they didnt). Sometimes, the puzzles require that you do some looking around the place but the solution is rarely far away.\nThe game was designed with a large audience in mind.\n\nThe quests are varied, though smaller sidequests are a bit limited. You'll find several in the castle and some in the villages. In total there might not be more than 50 smaller sidequests. Not counting the main questline and major sidequests. Its especially these sidequests that are good and one in particular.\nI think my main issue is that after a while, you will have done all sidequests and most of the world is a sandbox with enemies. Many of which respawn. But apart from the vendors, only questgivers will talk to you, until you've done their quest. Thats unfortunate.\n\nThe main quest has variation and its unique enemies, aswell as puzzles. This main quest is required to advance the game itself.\nHL relies on a levelling system and you will gradually unlock spells as you play parts of the main questline, buildings and tools. Some equipment like brooms level locked aswell. Personally not a great fan of the system but its okay.\n\nThe clothing, of which there is a wide variety in this game, is also knitted into the level system. Outfits will have offense and defense qualities. The higher your level, the better the outfits you find. You'll also be able to improve some of these stats if you advance far enough in the main questline.\nThe game fortunatly has a transmog system, allowing you to use the gear with the best statistics while retaining the look of whatever clothing takes your fancy.\nIn school I wore the school robes, but in the highlands I picked coats and jackets I liked best. Appareantly in the lore, fifth year students are allowed to wear whatever they like under their school robes when in class.\n\nI greatly enjoy the game and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes HP. Feels a little bit Elden Ring though a little bit easier. The game is an experience rather than a challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1677387118, "timestamp_updated": 1677387118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133638098": {"recommendationid": "133638098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160054592", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 16052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11106, "playtime_at_review": 15235, "last_played": 1677437050}, "language": "english", "review": "i'm a very casual HP fan, as in I've read the books and watched most of the movies only once except for maybe the third and fourth movies a few more times when I used to have cable and they happen to be on TV.

It's not like this is a perfect game, but it's still the best single player RPG I've played in years, especially because it doesn't force me to play in first person.\n\nThere are definitely things I would add to the game or give more importance to but it's still a truly immersive experience and I'm already enjoying what changes can be made with mods that give more freedom with character customization etc. Considering this game was made by a team without experience in single player RPGs, and they've mentioned the limitations they faced over the last few years, I'm really excited to see what we get from DLC and future games in the franchise.

I wouldn't call it \"woah, that's amazing\" or \"omg, didn't see that coming\" type of story. But it was enough to keep me engage and continue instead of sleeping on time. The sidequests seems to influence the main story quest to some degree during the dialogues. However I am able to confirm this.\n\nCombat - I found the combat quite challenging at times. Although it is also not too hard. It became somewhat easier as I got used to the controls, got more spells, and managed to finally achieve my bankai speeding through the combat area. Using potions and/or the herbs does give a huge help on the difficult ones but not necessary.\n\nGraphics - Like my previous reviews this is not my department. I play at low/medium settings and had no issue with it so far. Combined with vast beautiful world to explore, this is where the graphics of the game tend to shine. There are a few random stuttering if I'm nitpicking. But it's kind of a normal for me and it doesn't bother me. No really, it doesn't.\n\nExploration - What can I say - it's a vast beautiful world to explore. There are 'teleport stations/floo' so walking might be a viable option if you really want to find the nooks and crannies. There is also other modes of tranport like the broom which looks really comfy to sit on. I did find landing difficult to begin with but I realized at some point that you can just hold the button for it.\n\nOther Features - When I'm sneaking, my character will say spells quietly such as \"revelio\" and I thought that was pretty cool.\n\nI have enjoyed my experience with this game and would recommend it to others and newcomers to the series.

A lot of things the devs got right with this game that other big companies with AAA games strived to achieve but failed miserably. Lookin at you cyberpunk.\n\nFor me, the game was worth the price and I enjoyed every single second of it. I'm done with the main story as of writing this review but I still have a few side quests remaining and a lot more areas to discover. This will probably be my first ever game on steam to 100%.\n\nMy only irks:\nStory - A little short for my liking. I thought I'd get to have main quests that'll take me all throughout the areas but nope, you have to explore them on your own.\n\nGame Play - More spells! I have no complaints about the current spell sets but I kinda wanted more. There's no way I'd be a 5th year going to Hogwarts with only a few spells in my pocket. \n\nCutscenes - I wish we could pause cutscenes so I can take pictures. That's all I ask for.\n\nTransportation - Faster brooms when?\n\nBugs - AI gets confused very rarely when you pull them from their designated \"work space\" as I like to call them. They just run in a 2x2 square feet endlessly and just stops doing anything else other than running in that tiny 2x2 space. It's funny with the bugs so I guess this doesn't technically count as an irk.\n\nWith that said, the game is very fun, engaging, immersive and it has some interesting dialogue choices for you to choose from, nothing too game changing don't worry. If you're a fan of the Harry Potter universe then you'll enjoy playing this game and will get most of the references and minute details engraved in everything from hogwarts up to the highlands.\n\nThanks to the Devs & Publisher for making this game possible and for putting in the time and effort for such a great title release. I know as of now they're not thinking of releasing DLC's for extra content but I really hope they would consider doing one in the future. \n\n*cough* Reinstating Quidditch Questline *cough*.", "timestamp_created": 1677384018, "timestamp_updated": 1677384018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133635482": {"recommendationid": "133635482", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065084308", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3448, "playtime_at_review": 3371, "last_played": 1677388555}, "language": "english", "review": "love it!\n", "timestamp_created": 1677384003, "timestamp_updated": 1677384003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133635357": {"recommendationid": "133635357", "author": {"steamid": "76561199432668120", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 208, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 208, "playtime_at_review": 208, "last_played": 1677376452}, "language": "english", "review": "AVADA KADAVRA", "timestamp_created": 1677383841, "timestamp_updated": 1677383841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133635290": {"recommendationid": "133635290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195041754", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 718, "playtime_at_review": 2206, "last_played": 1677428177}, "language": "english", "review": "What\u00b4s there to say.

I had to play since the trans community from Twitter and Reddit were coping all over this. (Disclaimer: I don't have a problem with LGBT people. I don't dislike them. I only dislike narcissists and assholes. That simple.)  For context, I watched the movies and love the Harry Potter franchise so naturally, I would be drawn to this.\n\nNow onto the review:\n\nThe graphics are good.\n\nThe story is kinda boring but it's not bad. Could honestly be done better. \n\nYes, this place is like any RPG but that isn't bad. The RPG mechanics works really well. \n\nI like the combat, the powers, and all that. Especially in an open-world environment. The world itself is pretty and it reminds me of the Witcher world without the gory aspect.\n\nI like the side quests. You can fly on a broom and compete against broom racers to upgrade it. Some of the collectibles are pretty tedious to collect. The Merlin trials aren't that challenging, collecting those moon owls was a pain because I needed to collect them to unlock a spell I needed to collect more cosmetics. \n\n I love the customization of my characters, clothes, and wand. I especially like it when I can switch the look on a robe so I don't look like a clown.  \n\nI love how through the main story and side quests I can choose what kind of wizard I want to be. Most of all, this game isnt riddled with micro transactions. \n\nNow the major problem I have is the rendering. When I exit Hogwarts the sun gets super bright like there's a damn light bulb in my eye. Then you can see there are some things that are still being rendered. Trees, walls, the floor, etc.\nOverall it's a good game. A fun one in fact. I cant wait for a online feature so I can cast a unforgivable curse on my friends. \n\nNow I really like this game and I think everyone should try it despite the hot takes on it and the attempted boycott that failed. Please do not be intimidated by the mob. I just wanna congratulate Avalanche Software for making an amazing game. The Trans community of Reddit and Twitter and their \"allies\" who harass and doxes people who simply play a fucking game should be ashamed of themselves. The only people I feel bad for are the Trans-people (who arent assholes) who've been misrepresented by these self-righteous low-life vultures.

A non-Harry Potter fan may not love this game as much as one who is, much of the draw, exploration and awe is connected to one's love for this universe, I was very excited to see things I was surprised they included and seeing the school is amazing (I won't spoil what is there but it's plenty). I could make a whole essay on the little and big incredible things this game does but here is my attempt to condense that.\n\nPROS\nThe side quest and exploration is plentiful without being overwhelming (despite all the icons on the map, most of which is just a location marker), the story is fairly decent and the side characters (especially Sebastian and Poppy) really shine and Natsai if you're a lore nerd! The game does dish itself out rather slow in the beginning and it takes a while to unlock everything, which was a bit annoying at first but I ended up enjoying how some side content was short and not introduced and meant last the entire game.\n\nCombat was very fun and varied and as the game went on, you get more and more tools. I played on hard and ever so often a Troll would feel like a sponge but for the most part, this was not an option and the game was fun but not difficult to frustration, playing on an easier difficulty for me personally likely would have mad it too easy. The Unforgivable Curses are very strong, but understandably so but this doesn't effect balance and they come pretty late into the game. All-in-all it was fun, flashy, didn't get stale, and you get to cast Bombarda, which is incredibly fun to say, \n\nThe gear system works really well, the transmog being unlocked from the start and being able to customize my appearance/hair in-game was nice. Gear never felt super relevant, just throw on whatever is best and move on, which I actually liked not having to worry so much about the gear. The outfits also look incredible and is some of the best male clothing options I've seen in almost any game. The hair also looks like hair someone from this century would have and whoever made the hair deserves an award. \n\nThe game also looks incredible and ran perfectly fine on my PC. I maybe had 2 or 3 bugs and one was a quest disappearing from the log despite me never finishing it (I didn't even notice until I went finish my collection and I needed one more side quest, I had to go find the NPC and talk to them but never had a quest or marker for it) but nothing major, which was really nice.\n\nI was also really impressed with some small things, like if you tip the musician in Hogsmead and return he will have a new instrument and thank you for donating to get it, and it happens a few times! Students will get howlers from parents when you roam the hallways, which is fun and the paintings moving look incredible and add such life. The music is also incredible as well. \n\nCONS\nThe only cons were (and I did my best to not believe this) that the story options are mostly null and mean nothing, You can make some jerk choices and say some pretty messed up stuff but at the end of the day the story ends the same and you can't do anything unforgivable. There is no evil path. \n\nI think Sebastian's questline ended kind of unresolved fully, I don't know if they anticipated his popularity and have planned DLC for him but it felt weird. \n\nIt doesn't seem like you can finish the collection without DLC, which is really sad for people who like to 100% games but you can finish the challenges 100% and I did but not being able to finish collectibles will be sad for some people. \n\n\nIf you love Harry Potter, just buy the game, you will love it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1677379178, "timestamp_updated": 1677379178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133631471": {"recommendationid": "133631471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198810139088", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1440, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1350, "playtime_at_review": 1315, "last_played": 1677434135}, "language": "english", "review": "its hot", "timestamp_created": 1677379143, "timestamp_updated": 1677379143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133631439": {"recommendationid": "133631439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150951569", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3238, "playtime_at_review": 5807, "last_played": 1677399560}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, very immersive.

Let me start by saying I really enjoy the HP world and this game does a really good job at making you feel like you are in this world. I thoroughly enjoyed the game and the story line, but it's not without it's faults. This game is really banking off the fans of the series buying this game and ignoring some of the laziness of the development. A few examples of this is the fact that this is nothing more than a console port and it's so extremely aggravating how annoying that is. You unlock some 15ish spells but can only use a bank of 4.. yes, 4. You have to scroll or switch to the other banks to use those spells. When you have a mouse with 12 programmable and a keyboard with a few micro programmable keys, why must I cater to the $20 controller with only 4 buttons? I believe there are some modders that are working on that but it shouldn't be a mod. There are several \"puzzles\" that is really just a rotation of the same 4 or 5, so once you've done about 5 puzzles, you've done all of them.. luckily again, there's mods that help with that now. There's MMO style of color codding clothing but for no reason really? I also don't understand the reasoning to search each chest because 90% of the time all the gear is worse than what you already have after level 20. I never upgraded my gear to max, the most I had is one piece of gear upgraded to 2(out of 3) and even in the final boss fight the items found in the chest were worse off than the gear i found at level 20, I fought the final boss at level 30 but to each their own on that aspect. There's a lot of filler quest that feels like they put it in there just to give you stuff to do to make their game last longer. This really had the potential to be one of the most amazing games, especially for the fans, but it just falls short. \n\nIt ran fine for me, but I ran it on Medium settings. 60 Fps with a 3060 and R5 3400 with 32g of ram . \n\nEven with all the frustrating flaws with the game I still enjoyed it and loved the main story line and wish they would make it a movie one day. I do recommend it, especially if you are a fan of the HP world, but I say wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1677378162, "timestamp_updated": 1677378162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133630557": {"recommendationid": "133630557", "author": {"steamid": "76561199477078136", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 137, "last_played": 1676078235}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the whole open world", "timestamp_created": 1677378079, "timestamp_updated": 1677378079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133630525": {"recommendationid": "133630525", "author": {"steamid": "76561199003862540", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 371, "playtime_at_review": 2671, "last_played": 1677429823}, "language": "english", "review": "abra cadabra irl", "timestamp_created": 1677378048, "timestamp_updated": 1677378048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133630433": {"recommendationid": "133630433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198386759680", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2752, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2752, "playtime_at_review": 2384, "last_played": 1677402384}, "language": "english", "review": "dope", "timestamp_created": 1677377930, "timestamp_updated": 1677377930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133630299": {"recommendationid": "133630299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294428478", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2325, "playtime_at_review": 2427, "last_played": 1677437478}, "language": "english", "review": "I love love the game, just being so immersed into the world is almost like actually being there. \nThere are a few things that I think could use a little tweaking:  like flying... i've played mmo games where mounts exist , and they are sooo much better than the flight in HL.

Its large budget has been applied competently. Special awards go to the atmosphere and fanservice. It feels that developers are well-familiar with the Wizarding World and love it. This dive into the favorite universe initially enraptured me so much, that I was not able to see the actual problems this game has. \n\nBut if we slice the aspects of the game into pieces, most of them are relatively primitive or even poorly designed. The plot and the characters are unamusing, open world activities are repetitive and with dubious awards, as game, for some reason, adopted the Diablo-like randomly dropping loot system. Tiny inventory and inconvenient menus together with the above-mention loot system slow down the tempo of the game a lot. \n\nThere are 2 aspects that actually made me leave a positive review: \n1. Combat and puzzle solving based on spell combinations. While combat is designed better, there are some puzzles in the game, which actually require some brain activity. But battles are extremely pleasant and entertaining. I haven't got tired of it. \n2. Exploring.

However, it does come with certain downsides and questionable moments, which doesn't spoil an overall experience.[/b]\n\nFirst and foremost, the RPG tag is misleading. [b]Hogwarts Legacy[/b] is not an RPG game in any capacity. It has some features characteristic of RPG games, such as leveling up, talents, gear, and dialogues, but it doesn't make it a role-playing game. Name an AAA title that doesn't have at least some of these nowadays. [b]Hogwarts Legacy[/b] does not feature the defining thing which makes a game [i]role-playing[/i] - choices and consequences. You can run around breaking into restricted places and casting forbidden spells, and no one will raise an eyebrow. Sure, you will make choices in dialogues, but your decisions don't matter. The main story will keep you strictly on the rails, and most of the side quests are just about going somewhere, doing something, and coming back. Dialogues here are for pure immersion, which is lovely, but don't expect anything beyond that. There definitely was a potential for role play, given the nature of the story and the setting itself, but it was never realized for some reason.\n\nAs for the story itself, it's... okay. It's undoubtedly epic and exciting to follow most of the time. However, there're specific segments when it feels frankly dragged for the sake of dragging. I mean, a dozen of main story quests could've easily been optional. Characters are primarily one-dimensional but still well-written and voiced. If you have a kink for accents as I do, then you would probably find satisfying how diverse the voiceover cast is, which makes every character, even barely presented ones, feel unique. \n\nIn terms of progression, [b]Hogwarts Legacy[/b] is an example for many open-world games out there. Unlocking various side activities, additional spells, and locations is tied to your story and side quest progression, which I found very convenient since the game doesn't overwhelm you with everything it has to offer at once but instead unlocks it step by step. It makes the game more balanced in terms of pace. However, there's one questionable decision, which made my first dozen hours in the game a bit frustrating. You must reach a certain point in the story to unlock talents required to customize your build and grant additional effects to your spells, potions, etc. This mechanic is fundamental for a game like this. However, it's, for some reason, locked behind 5-10 hours of gameplay, depending on difficulty and how distracted you will be by some side activities. Of course, you can speedrun the story until a particular moment to gain access to your talents and then play and explore comfortably. Still, if you're playing for the first time, you're most likely unaware of how long it will take you to unlock the actual leveling up, and without talents, your combat and exploration options are pretty limited. Craft, another crucial gameplay element, is hidden even further behind multiple side quests. This decision is justified from the story perspective but still seems questionable gameplaywise. \n\nSpeaking of combat. Overall I found it fun and engaging, not to mention each encounter looks spectacular due to the variety of spells and other ways to fight your enemies. The game allows you to wield all the most well-known conjures from books and movies, even unforgivable ones, which you can use in combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. However, I found battles rather exhausting than fun until halfway through the main story due to a limited arsenal. Only after I unlocked most of the spells and upgraded them did the combat finally shine. \n\nRegarding exploration and the open world, [b]Hogwarts Legacy[/b] is fantastic, especially if you're a Harry Potter fan like I used to be years ago. The devs nailed it with good attention to the details while recreating the magical world we used to know only through books and movies, especially in Hogwarts castle. I guarantee you will spend hours exploring only the school itself, not to mention Hogsmead and dozens of small hamlets, caves, and tombs. Some locations are breathtaking, which makes the lack of photo mode a considerable downside. However, after a certain point, when you'll explore enough and the sense of discovery becomes dull, you will most likely see that it's nothing more than an average AAA open world with question marks and bandit camps, with challenges and puzzles more suitable for an MMO rather than a single-player game. Still, there were enough moments throughout the game, no spoilers, which were done so well in terms of atmosphere and immersion that it ultimately outweighed all the secondariness of the surrounding activities. \n\nFrom the technical side, [b]Hogwarts Legacy[/b] is far from perfect. I experienced constant fps drops and stuttering here and there while my rig was more than decent to run the game with the settings I used. Facial animations are weird outside of pre-rendered cutscenes, and most of the dialogues are just talking heads with occasional gesticulation. However, overall, [b]Hogwarts Legacy[/b] looks beautiful, primarily because of design, attention to detail, and visual style rather than graphics quality.\n\nIn my book, [b]Hogwarts Legacy[/b] is a great game. I admire how devs recreated the wizarding world and used every advantage of the setting beloved by millions to create a massive interactive experience, which, despite being rough around the edges, is good enough to stand in line with the genre's best.", "timestamp_created": 1677370801, "timestamp_updated": 1677372544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133624243": {"recommendationid": "133624243", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974395707", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2769, "playtime_at_review": 2810, "last_played": 1677396769}, "language": "english", "review": "fun with tons of mini games/puzzles to solve", "timestamp_created": 1677370781, "timestamp_updated": 1677370781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513108611106872559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133624241": {"recommendationid": "133624241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847004678", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1566, "playtime_at_review": 1516, "last_played": 1677409131}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS SOOOOOO GOOOOOD.

I would have expected something to actually happen after choosing the evil route as your final choice.

It's not going to make me buy a PS5, it's just going to make me salty at the publisher/developers.\n\nOther than the aforementioned issues, the game is a ton of fun - and it lasts for quite a while.

It works very well and the effects and combos are efficient and beautiful.\n\nThis game really feels like a movie, you go to class, learn spells, make friends and uncover whats going on with the main plot. Its the same pacing as the Harry Potter movies and really adds to the nostalgia. \n\nThe main plot starts slow but really picks up in the back half once you learned all the spells and the pay off was amazing. However, the main plot fails in comparison to the side stories for your friends. Namely Sebastian's quests......Holy, that was epic, frightful and amazing. I felt way more engaged in my friends quests, than I did with the main plot, but overall, I liked both. I would 1000% recommend doing the friend quests prior to completing the main campaign. The writing for them is exceptionally good and fits perfectly with the narrative.\n\nMy only negative was that there is no REAL choice in this game. I learned all 3 unforgivable curses, and used them in combat and no one really cared and it also did not factor into the ending at all. There is also no choice in siding with the goblins or not. Its just, you seal up the power or take it for yourself and that's it, that's what defines good vs bad; but the cutscenes for both is barely any different. And if you are at least level 34 when completing the game, then you can get the true ending by talking to Weasley and then attending the grand hall to see a nice wholesome wrap-up to the story - even if you picked to take the power and be evil.....NO ONE CARES! I would have liked to see more world changing for being evil and definitely some reaction from the teachers or something; but other than that, this game was super fun and felt wonderful.\n\n8/10 Story\n- Very cool, slow build, no real variance in ending choices or impact.\n\n20/10 Side stories\n-Excellent character writing and progression, big impact (Sebastian's choices), you have some choice in what happens for 1 of them.\n\n10/10 Combat\n-Fluid, great combo system, amazing visuals, user friendly, FUN, and Avada Kadabra ACTUALLY 1 shots EVERYTHING. Its not an end game, unforgivable OP curse for nothing. If you face a boss enemy, it will 1 shot it, true to its name/lore and reputation. Some people may not like that, but I think its quite fitting. If you don't like it, don't use that spell. However if you feel like playing God, curse every enemy on the field, then use AK on them and (if you upgraded the spell) watch every single enemy disintegrate into oblivion and then revel in your unlimited power.\n- You get combat PLANTS! Which sounds ridiculous, but holy hell they are GOOD! Don't sleep on them. Even without learning the spells, if you uses potion buffs and combat plants, you are easily OP within seconds.\n- There are many ways to play and anyone can mix and match and have a great time.\n-You can stealth too if you wish.\n\n10000000/10 Beast Vivariums\n- You can rescue and breed beasts and groom and/or play with them. I didn't think I would care about this but when i saw the baby Fwooper waddle running around, I melted. Absolutely melted. That is the cutest thing I have ever seen. Its also nice that the animals give you feathers/hair to be used to upgrade your gear, so its worth seeing and spending time with them.\n\n10/10 Room customization\n- I thoroughly enjoyed changing every single aspect of my Room of Requirement to be exactly what i wanted it to be. You can customize everything! The walls, floors, ceiling, windows, and every single item in that room. Different styles and colours and many many many unlockable options to make that space your own. You can even change the lighting and ambience. I had a gothic mixed with greek architecture, all black, but with moonlight ambience and lighting to make my room have a blue reflection to it - it really suited my dark lord ravenclaw theme.\n\n7/10 World building/Impact from choices\n- Its a nice and beautiful environment, but does not change from your play style at all.\n\n8/10 Mount options\n- Broom flight actually feels realistic and janky and it doesn't feel bad at all. You need to master the controls to be pro at it, which is a nice touch of realism for me. Beast mounts are okay but broom is definitely the better way to go for efficiency. \n\n10/10 Character customization is very diverse\n- Despite the backlash, you can absolutely look and sound like anything you want. If you want to appear straight, gay, bi, or trans, you absolutely can do that. It might not be perfect, but its close enough to make most people feel like they can personalize their character to match what they want. NOTE: There is a very obvious and clearly trans side character and when doing their quests; you will discover that 1 of the teachers is lesbian and that this character helped them accept themselves and embrace who they are. No matter how you feel about JK Rowling, this game studio did their own thing and made sure every player can relate and feel represented within this game. When you talk to some merchants, you can also see and hear this as well. Its a diverse and beautiful world that we live in and this game tries to match that as well.\n\n10/10 Level progression.\n- You only level up by LEARNING, which I thought I was going to hate, but i didn't. Just cast Revelio every 5 seconds and collect all the field guide pages that you can and you will level up super fast. Its not about grinding enemies, its about exploration. There are combat challenges, but that's more for unlocking cosmetics than leveling up. To increase your character level, you fill up your field guide and do quests - which in my opinion, feels logical for this type of setting. You're a student Harry, go to class and do your homework!\n\nOverall i had a wonderful time. I farmed plants, made potions in bulk, raised animals and discovered all sorts of wonders during my time at Hogwarts.

That said it doesn't really have a great replay value since even if you choose a diferent house, little changes in the long run, as its mostly cosmetic with a Single Quest that leads you through a different path depending of the house you choose.

The entire hogwarts building has moving pictures, magical musical instruments, moving statues and ghosts running around. This is the best game with Harry Potter gameplay ever made and I would love to give it a 10/10 but there is a lot of small flaws and QoL that it needs. You can fly with a broom and a mount but there is most likely you will never use the mount besides the intro area. It takes so long to get on it and actually fly while the broom is instant. With the game being around 30 hours long, there is not enough enemies, you will always feel like your fighting the same ones. There is no bosses besides 1 at the end of the game and some statue type bosses that is always the same model.

Their hard work, dedication, and patience in developing this masterpiece. Thank god they made the choice to delay the game! it was perfect in every aspect.

However, it delivers an intense beginning to the story, with enjoyable levels of fan-service that reference the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts movies. The game's overall atmosphere is positive, and it benefits from almost flawless technical implementation, a rare feat in today's gaming industry.\n\nOne of the game's strengths is its strong combat mechanics, which start simple but become more complex and engaging as the game progresses. The graphical design and art style are also impressive, especially at extreme settings at 4K, although a decent PC is required to run the game this way.\n\nOn the downside, the game suffers from repetitiveness and an overabundance of points of interest on the map, which can feel like mere placeholders after a while. The Merlin trials also feel lackluster, and the caves and camps become monotonous after the middle game. These factors contribute to the game feeling like a grind, which may not be appealing to non-diehard fans of the series. The sound and music also become repetitive, which can be a turn-off.\n\nThe most significant technical problem is the difficulty in focusing on enemies or objects when there are many on the screen. The user interface could also be more user-friendly, with features like a \"Sell All\" button or the ability to buy multiple potions at once.\n\nDespite these flaws, there is potential for interesting story-based DLCs in other locations, which could make for an enjoyable gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1677363044, "timestamp_updated": 1677363044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

After awhile the combat is really repetitive and the fact that you can't get all the talents unlocked is somewhat frustrating by the end. I felt that, though the potions and plants were a great addition, they were not even thought of most of the time when I was fighting (unless I needed to complete a duel feat). I'd say that maybe slowing down the fighting and making it a little more challenging and or rewarding to use the plants and potions would have made the combat feel more satisfying. \n\nMy main complaint with this game is the time-gated collectibles. Man, this is very frustrating to have in this type of game. Sure, the revelio pages and the additional information throughout the castle is welcomed and I think adds to the atmosphere of Hogwarts and the surrounding area. However, this game is constantly like, \"oh yeah, collect this now\" and after awhile you're sitting there way too overwhelmed and begin to become apathetic to collecting the useless objects. Landing pads, balloons, Merlin trials (oh boy those are very redundant), and my least favorite, the Demiguise statues, are all way too obnoxious and most of these get unlocked later when you've already been through some areas. My biggest complaint of these is the Demiguise statues, not as it pertains to collecting, but the Alohamora spell. I have no real reason as to why they decided to add a utterly soul-sucking and useless minigame to unlocking locks with a magic spell that unlocks locks automatically OR giving the spell \"levels.\" It was bad enough that I had to go through Hogsmeade and surrounding caves and see locks that I could not unlock, but to then be like \"oh yeah hehe this is Level 2 and 3 you can't do those yet until you collect more statues\" was utterly obnoxious and made me feel like giving up on completing this game 100%. I'm someone who does love collect-em-all games, but the way in which they decided to do it irked me. \n\nMy last complaint is that I wish I would have gotten more character development from the teachers, close students (my friends??? far stretch), and even the main baddie. The end was pretty pathetic and the story was a little underwhelming since it was rushed at the end, even though I thought it started off masterfully. \n\nDon't get me wrong, at the end of the day this is a solid game.

It does this by incorporating a need for education, by serving the purpose of training you in the over two dozen spells in the game. That is to say, that the education system stops there. Any who come to Hogwarts: Legacy expecting a simulation of classroom life will be soured by the experience. Your chosen house makes very little difference in the gameplay experience, in truth, your house really has no value at all in the overall scheme of the game, since most of your time will be spent outside the school performing tasks that are unrelated to education.\n\nHowever, Hogwarts Legacy does manage to capture what it's like to be a Special Child like 'ol lighning scar himself. You are set against the backdrop of the school, and given the barest amount of instruction in how to handle the myriad of messes you'll find yourself in. I oftentimes found myself stumped or confused as to how to solve a puzzle because I hadn't completed the requisite course to acquire the spell needed to solve it. You'll also be getting attacked by basically everything that exists outside of the many spotted hamlets and towns in the Scottish Highlands; be they brigands or bandits, poachers or dark wizards, spiders or trolls. The fun within this game lies in the combat. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is great, and the story is damn good. But the combat here is unlike anything I've played in my storied history of playing video games. You'll find yourself frequently rushing to pick the correct spell, or quickly aborting an expelliarmus in order to cast a protego, to avoid being disarmed yourself.\n\nThe game does an amazing job of making the combat feel like real wizarding combat, sure. You can possibly survive in a fight against a dozen dark wizards, but you're going to have a difficult time, as every diffindo or crucio cast your way will create a hazard requiring a dodge, and all other spells will need to be blocked with protego. Now, it sounds on the face to be a straightforward think, this combat. The change comes, however, in the form of spell interactions. You see, a hastily cast glacius could lead into any number of others, such as a simple basic cast, or maybe an incendio. However, if you instead opt for a diffindo, descendo, or depulso, you'll be pleasantly rewarded with bonus damage due to the interaction of slamming or slashing the ice, causing it to shatter. These interactions are many and virtually none are explained by the courses, these are the things you must teach yourself. And all this is without getting into the fact that spells can be uniquely effective on certain creatures in certain cirucmstances. For example, cast a flippendo right after blocking a troll's club with a perfectly timed protego? Great, you just flipped that troll's club right up into his smug face. Cast a descendo while a spider is preparing a strike, bam - you've just buried that spiders fangs into the ground. This goes a long way toward making the combat feel real. \n\nThat being said. The game does have some pretty glaring gaps that prevent it from being a complete experience. The lack of depth in the gear system is my biggest gripe, with the lack of quidditch being a close second. But there is one area that the game succeeds entirely, and that is being good. It's hard to remember the last time we had a really good magic-based RPG experience. So Hogwarts Legacy manages to squeeze itself in at the exact perfect time to be appreciated for what it does well.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1677361023, "timestamp_updated": 1677361023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133614161": {"recommendationid": "133614161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040112024", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3075, "playtime_at_review": 2901, "last_played": 1677432615}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth the price tag", "timestamp_created": 1677360913, "timestamp_updated": 1677360913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133614109": {"recommendationid": "133614109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052236263", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5962, "playtime_at_review": 8026, "last_played": 1677437871}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the game.

They made sure to have every detail spot on from the books when making this masterpiece. I highly enjoyed taking my time playing this. Word of advice: is DO NOT rush the main quest! Explore. Collect. Side Quests. Then when there nothing left progress with the Main Quest to unlock more side quests and collectibles.\n\nProps to the DEVs for making sure that players can set clothing cosmetics to their liking without having to compromise stats, (I think other game developers could learn from this).\n\nThe main story line is well thought out and executed wonderful. Each side-character's development is not only eventful, but also moving as the story progress. (I personally tear'd up at the end of Natty's Quest Lines)\n\nThe cherry on top is for sure having your own room to customize with magical beasts to care for. **Gotta Catch Them All** However, I do wish there was more you could do with the beasts you capture. Also having your own cat/owl/frog in your room would be nice as well.\n\nCan't wait to see what other DLC they'll add in the future..", "timestamp_created": 1677360545, "timestamp_updated": 1677360545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133613708": {"recommendationid": "133613708", "author": {"steamid": "76561199026284740", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2646, "playtime_at_review": 3132, "last_played": 1677437485}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game.

Here's a nice puzzle :D *Now go and do the same puzzle 95 times*.\n\n-The game felt a little abanonded outside hogwarts and hogsmeade. sure the map is insanely big, however I feel as though most of it was unnecessary after finishing all the main and side quests. So unless you are a perfectionist that wants to gather 100% of all collectables there isnt any reason other than the quests to visit them.\n\nBesides those cons of the game I truly recommend this to everyone that has some spare money and time left.

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You\u2019ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified \u2018special circumstances\u2019. The virtual rendition of Rowling\u2019s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic \u2018manifest destiny\u2019 archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can\u2019t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you\u2019ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of \u2018metroidvania\u2019 fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you\u2019ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you\u2019ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe\u2019s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you\u2019ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you\u2019ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such \u201clong-term\u201d goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don\u2019t need, or other cosmetics that aren\u2019t worth the effort.", "timestamp_created": 1677358678, "timestamp_updated": 1677358678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683044195175170898", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133611363": {"recommendationid": "133611363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181516541", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1109, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1109, "playtime_at_review": 1020, "last_played": 1677391491}, "language": "english", "review": "Professor Garlick can Garlick my wand.", "timestamp_created": 1677358533, "timestamp_updated": 1677358533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133611345": {"recommendationid": "133611345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079371234", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 2468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1490, "playtime_at_review": 2468, "last_played": 1677358052}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome!!", "timestamp_created": 1677358518, "timestamp_updated": 1677358518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133611180": {"recommendationid": "133611180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198388621398", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 931, "playtime_at_review": 787, "last_played": 1677437224}, "language": "english", "review": "For fans of the Harry Potter series, this game is a must play.

The excitement was palpable for me once the story started. I'm approximately 2/3rds the way through the game and it's been a blast to play. There's a ton of exploration and customization in-game with how you want to be dressed and look. The combat is enjoyable aside from some rubber-banding from certain enemies. You will spend more time outside of the school than you will inside it since the outside world is so much larger than that of the castle. So if you're looking for a game that you spend most of the time inside Hogwarts then you might be disappointed by how little time you end up spending it there. Graphically speaking the game is gorgeous and they fully fleshed out the school. They have puzzles around the entirety of it and the outside world even if some of them are kinda simple others not so much. The main story is also from what I can see pretty short so that could also be a point of contention for some as well. If you don't mind this then all the power to you, you'll enjoy the game.\n\nMy main gripe with the game is the framerate dropping. I've got a decent rig with a 3070ti and 32 GBs of RAM and I'll have framerate drops going from 70-80 fps to 8-9 fps. This is with ray-tracing turned off and most of the settings on either High or Medium. Like any game that has combat in it if your frames drop during it then you start to make mistakes and you get screwed and that can be frustrating so make sure it's turned off and it should be smoother and you shouldn't deal with the drops as much. The other issue I had was after a while some of the exploration feels repetitive but that may also be because I'm dumb and started exploring as soon as I could and am behind in the main story compared to where I am exploration wise. The faces in game show expressions only when the person is talking to you and then as soon as they finish it's back to what looks like an expressionless mannequin. I know in the HP universe there's a thing called occlumency and it keeps your face from showing emotion but it seems like everyone is an expert at it once they stop talking to your character so take that into account. The broom riding is fun and personally my preferred method of travel if not using the fast travel method but the turning is pretty slow but once again that could be chalked up to me constantly being at full speed on the thing as well so it just doesn't handle like I would think it should. There are also ALOT of cut scenes granted you can skip them but take note of it. Also you're choices don't really make much  of a difference in what happens to your character. If you use the Dark Arts nothing bad happens to your character, there are no consequences so that's also a downside in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1677358153, "timestamp_updated": 1677358805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133610789": {"recommendationid": "133610789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198797346015", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1436, "playtime_at_review": 3504, "last_played": 1677368657}, "language": "english", "review": "Muy bien.

It gets compared to Witcher3, Skyrim, Elden Ring and so on. In no way can it rival the writing and scope of Witcher3, the open world and character customization of Skyrim or the combat and sense of accomplishment of Elden Ring. \n\nTo me it has a flair like Fable did and also borrows a page from Dragon Age Inqiusition.\nHogwarts Legacy is fun to play while it lasts, but has an utterly forgettable story and cast. For the life of me I can not remember what Fable was about, only that it was a fun game. I think the same will be true for HL in a couple of years. HL also has the pointless puzzles, collections and side quests that DA:I has. The world in HL is filled with 10 minute endorphin boosts, does not evolve or change and is fairly empty otherwise.\n\nThe same is true for many of its systems. All items have 1 of two stats, which are offense or defense. On level up you gain health, which is the only other character stat in the game. Upgrading items adds the missing stat, so upgrading a defense item adds offense. Items can also hold one trait, of which there are many, but only a handful are actually worthwhile. Items come in several rarities, ranging up to legendary. Though legendary items simply provide more of their one respective stat.\n\nIn HL everything is present from crafting, critter catching and breeding, talents, mini-games, puzzles, dungeons, mounts, whatever. But nothing has any depth. You get spammed with everything, and barely need anything. The puzzles are simplistic (except maybe the depulso training rooms). The pacing of the talents is way off. Once I had built a character that offered some unique gameplay the game was over and HL does not have a late game. \n\nSo, why is this game still good?\nThe combat is very fluid and fun, while not being a button masher. Flinging spells feels very rewarding. I played on hard and some of the wavelike encounters and bosses were quite challenging. YMMV of course but I consider it one of the games strong points. \nThe world is very, very beautiful. There is a level of detail that is just amazing. Potted plants will periodically transform to another cut. There are flying watering cans or tiny stormclouds that water a field. Magic instruments will play music with students watching, the pictures/portraits all move. Basically much of the charm from the source material is present.  \n\nTake HL for what it is. A fun experience with nostalgia factor that will keep you entertained for about 40-60 hours and then move on. If you go in expecting it as rivaling the top dogs in the genre you will be disappointed. However HL comes almost free of bugs, crashed twice in my 60 hours (windows update forced it to minimize and one random crash) and performed okay (some frame drops in heavy duty areas after fast traveling there) on my 4 year old PC (mostly high settings @1080p).  \n\nIf you are not familiar with the movies or books you might want to wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1677352968, "timestamp_updated": 1677352968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133605048": {"recommendationid": "133605048", "author": {"steamid": "76561199172439083", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1922, "playtime_at_review": 1333, "last_played": 1677391784}, "language": "english", "review": "Unforgivable curses (that's all i got to say)", "timestamp_created": 1677352954, "timestamp_updated": 1677352954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133604913": {"recommendationid": "133604913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198298324396", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1055, "playtime_at_review": 1003, "last_played": 1677356052}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

And it's an enjoyable game, but as an open world game it falls short.\n\nIf you haven't played an open world game it's a good opener into it.  But as someone who has played several open world games, it really falls short.  The only karmic repercussions in the whole game is your own guilt.  Your decisions mean literally nothing with the exception of the final quest with Sebastion.  A lot of the stuff people were looking forward to are practically non-existent, (quidditch, azkaban for literally one cut scene, etc.)  NPCs are completely useless except as background noise until they're needed for a quest.  And frankly the game needs more content.  \n\nThe NPCs don't even acknowledge what house you're in.  All you need is 20 extra minutes in a sound room and a basic line of program to pull the appropriate one for the house.  They don't even acknowledge your house when announcing that you won the house cup.  They just say \"your house.\"  There's no way to loose house points like in previous games and risk not winning house cup.  The fact that 30 seconds into a puzzle the NPC and even my own character starts telling me how to solve it (let me at least try and if i'm stuck give me the option to talk to the npc for hints).  Zero repercussions for your character.  Ever.  I used the killing curse? The only thing that happens is NPCs mention it in that battle.  That's it. Nothing else.  No friendship meter that you need to balance out, no morality meter.  The world outside of Hogwarts is nothing but filler material being mostly empty land.  The MMO style looting system is annoying at best and painful at worst.  The only actual decision that matters in the entire game is where to spend your talent points.  And even then, this isn't even multiplayer let alone an MMO, why are we putting arbitrary limits on skills?\n\nAvalanche studios has worked with Bethesda in the past.  They know what to do and what not to do.  And this isn't it.\n\nAnd that's before I get into the technical with the very frequent crashing, bugs, and weird ass pathmaking for the NPCs.\n\nThe combat is the only real entertaining part and even that gets overly repetitive when I'm fighting the same group of ashwinders for the 3rd time with the duelist off in the corner screaming petrificus totalis every 3 seconds.\n\nIf you never played open world and want a game to get you into them, this game is passable.  If you want a game to play for the nostalgic factor, go right ahead.  However, it doesn't have much else going for it and if you simply want the game for it's open world don't buy it.\n\nIf you really want to buy this game, wait till it's discounted.

You can't refine your skills of being a wizard in any way other than learning new spells- which is a one-and-done sort of thing.  \n\nAlso it runs like garbage, crashes on boot, complies shaders over and over (because, go figure, they don't bother testing anything these days).   Also I'm trying to boot it in the background and I've had to kill the process 2x while typing this review because it keeps getting hung up.  Apparently upon release it really sucks for Nvidia cards.  \n\nI really wanted to like this game but it has too much of a \"movie turned into a game\" feeling - like the lord of the rings games - where you are doing what the designers wanted you to do, instead of doing what you want to do.  So I'm not sure it can be considered an \"open world RPG\".  The interactions with NPCs is pretty shallow aside from the more important ones who give you sidequest missions (there are like 3 of them).  Plenty of NPCs give you missions but most of them are not really more than \"hey go find/kill/discover this thing and come back\".  The main quest is good but not anything spectacular, the boss fights are a little repetitive or they're just so weak I instakill them.  I really wanted to have a be your own wizard adventure at Hogwarts but this really isn't it.   \n\nNot horrible, Not great", "timestamp_created": 1677405485, "timestamp_updated": 1677405485, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190507411956787", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133652773": {"recommendationid": "133652773", "author": {"steamid": "76561199022321979", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1677322644}, "language": "english", "review": "Only preschool level of numerics required as total frames can be counted on one hand 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1677405275, "timestamp_updated": 1677405275, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133652546": {"recommendationid": "133652546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105774128", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2707, "playtime_at_review": 3490, "last_played": 1677140893}, "language": "english", "review": "Really wanted to love this game.

Especially because the combat system is quite good. But as it is, once you reach mid-game you are basically a teenage wizard demi-god dispatching whole groups of dark wizards and goblins like its nothing (played on hard btw).

For those of us who know the franchise, but didn't grow up living and breathing the franchise, Hogwarts Legacy makes a good first impression before devolving into a very rote and relatively uninteresting slog.  Which is a shame, because most of the parts of a good game are in there somewhere.\n\nHogwart's is gorgeous, there is no doubt.  Hogwarts itself is a complex maze filled with secrets and little incidental details and flair that make the school feel alive.  Exploring Hogwarts can be a lot of fun... at first.  By the end of the game, you will have roamed back and forth through the same halls a couple of dozen times, and as you do, the cookie-cutter approach to filling this game with content becomes all the more evident.\n\nHogwarts gets off to a VERY SLOOOOW start, doling out your skill progression slowly over the first 12-15 hours of play.  Early on, you are severely limited to the point that most side quests remain out of reach.  After about 15 hours, the game opens up a bit more, giving you a full arsenal to deal with.  After that, though, it continues to add more and more gameplay mechanics, like room-design, crafting, and animal husbandry, all of which can provide some perks in-game, but few of which have any meaningful use during the game.  All of those dangerous flowers you can grow and use in battle?  Yeah, forgot you even had items you could use in battle, didn't you?\n\nAnd that's the problem.  This game tries to do so much that it doesn't do much of anything well besides the combat, which itself is degraded by the fact that there are basically only 6 enemy types on repeat.  This isn't helped by the fact that XP and expanded inventory is only earned through completing side quests, which end up being rote fetch quests, or one of 4 simple puzzles on repeat.  \n\nThe game forces you to grind, which just feels lazy and designed to distract you from the fact that the story is fairly thin and uninspired.  \n\nThe game even blows a major opportunity when it comes to unlocking the broom.  Imagine my disappointment to find that the initial broom is so slow that it's literally faster to walk, and again, the broom upgrades are locked behind a side quest chain that is prone to glitching out and becoming unavailable.\n\nYes, open worlds can be buggy, but this one just feels beautiful yet uninspired.

The game is super immersive and the developers did a great job of making every aspect of the world fit with the theme and vibe of a Harry Potter novel; everything feels right and true to the genre.  \n\nThat said, the way that you level up is by pinging the map for hidden book pages and by advancing through run-and-go-fetch type quests; fighting doesn't really net you too much XP unless you are satisfying dueling goals or \"murder your 90th goblin\" type achievements.  This is neither challenging nor fun.  Also, the game throws locks all over the place in order to keep you from clearing out areas of the map too quickly.  I get why a developer would want to do that (the locks serve to wall off parts of the sandbox), but this approach takes a lot of the thrill out of exploration, as you need to re-explore, and then re-re-explore the same areas rather than advancing into somewhere new.  Finally, the combat is laughably easy; I don't even have all the spells yet, much less the \"unforgivable\" spells (which, evidently, let you one-shot entire groups of enemies) and I'm already death incarnate, even for mobs that the game warns me are \"too dangerous\" for my level.  Decisions have no consequences that I can see and the \"puzzles\" are designed for 5-6 year olds.  \n\nIn short, this is not a game for anyone who has blown the dust out of a NES cartridge.  If you've ever felt the satisfaction of killing the butterfly lady in Sekiro, then this will leave you deeply, deeply wanting.\n\nUltimately, this is a beautiful and immersive game.  I've already sunk 30+ hours into it, and I will probably sink another 20 just to finish it (I'm a tad OCD and have a hard time leaving chests un-opened), but I could just as easily walk and go right on living my life.

It's frustrating in the best of times, and game breaking at the worst of times. There are no permanent companions like was suggested by the trailer, and once you're done with the game that's it. There's hardly any replayability, since most side quests post game are just side quests you missed during it. Overall it felt rushed and unfinished. Not at all like a full open world rpg like they advertised.\nEven still, this game is fun. The story has its faults, but it's cute, and i really got attached to the majority of the characters. In fact, I've beaten it 3 times already, and as the hours I've played shows, I've been a bit obsessed with it. I've made 4 characters already, and remade two. I want it to improve.

You can just roam the magical world of Hogwarts and nearby places just taking in the scenery and play out the fantasy that you had as a little kid reading Harry Potter for the first time.\n\nIf you are not a Potter-head, this is still one of the best open world games currently available. And as all the story happens way before the events that take place in Harry Potter, you can still play this game without knowing anything about Potterverse.\n\nRatings -\n\nART - 11/10 | Mind-blowing. This is one of the most beautiful games ever made and if you have the graphics and processor speed to play this at max settings (you wont :D), it is so worth it. Both the castle and Hogsmeade are developed with care and the love that the devs had for this game really shines through.\n\nMUSIC - 10/10 | The game really delivers when it comes to music. They have captured the music to reflect the mood of any particular event in the game pretty well. You will also find some nostalgic tunes from the movies interspersed here and there.\n\nGAMEPLAY - 8.5/10 | This is subjective and will vary from player to player. Some of the combat does become repetitive (I am looking at you spiders), but it is keeping with the story setting which states that goblins and dark wizards have overrun large parts of areas near Hogwarts. The actual combat mechanics are absolutely fantastic, with a mix and match of different spells really keeping the combat fresh. My one complain is that if you keep doing all the side quests, you become kinda too overpowered with the gear and abilities and the fights become kinda easy towards the end part of the game, even at the hardest difficulty.\n\nREPLAYABILITY - 6/10 | The main story line is kinda same, so there is no real need to replay the game with a different house. There is only 1 minor difference in the main story line which is dependent on your house choice,which you can Youtube if you are curious.\n\nSTABILITY/BUGS - 9/10 | The game is relatively bug-free in my experience, though I did encounter a random spawning of a merchant on water once. But, hey, this is a game where magic is common-place, so I might have met Jesus disguised as a merchant :).\n\nMULTIPLAYER - 0/10 | This is a single player game.\n\nGRAPHICS - This is a graphics intensive game I was able to run the game on 4K resolution at a stable 70 fps with a mixture of medium and high settings with ray-tracing off and dlss performance. My specs are listed at the end of the review.\n\nRECOMMENDATION - 10/10 | I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game to anyone who loves Harry Potter or open world games. You will sink hours into this game and it will feel like a few minutes.\n\n\nMy system config -\n\nI was able to run the game on the following specs -\nOS - Win 11 (64 bit)\nGraphics - 8GB GDDR6 3070 Nvidia RTX laptop card (Mux switch enabled)\nRAM - 32 GB\nProcessor - AMD Ryzen 7 Octa core (4.4 GHz clock speed)\nHard Disk - SSD\n\n\nTLDR - A must play game for Potter-heads and open world game enthusiasts, with next level graphics.

"english", "review": "First off I would like to say that Hogwarts Legacy is a must have if you are a fan of the Harry Potter books, movies or universe. Its an amazing feeling to walk through Hogwarts and experience the magical world in this fun yet sometimes challenging RPG.\n\nDuring the time I played this game, I enjoyed myself immensely. The fact that I get to be a part of this amazing universe and use magic (even though its through a videogame LOL) transported me back to when I was a kid reading the books.\n\nThe Hogwarts atmosphere feels real and lively. Students walking the hallways, classes where you learn certain courses like Defense Against The Dark Arts, Herbology or Potions give you a feeling like belong. The game was able to make me feel fully immersed.\n\nThe music is great (albeit not masterful) and sells you the feeling of really being in this world. It has some familiar tunes if you have enjoyed the movies and their score before.\n\nThe combat is great and sells you the feeling like your spells are really doing damage and have an impact against your enemies. Some enemies are weaker to certain types of spells. The only downside is that sometimes combat can be a little repetitive. I personally didn\u2019t feel this way, but I have seen and read some reviews that mention this particular point, so I thought I would address it anyway.\n\nGraphically the game is beautiful. But it does require a pretty decent system to run it at these graphics. So be aware to check the minimum and recommended requirements before you purchase. Small tip: Turn off raytracing as soon as possible. This will help a lot. (Definitely when you run around in Hogwarts castle.)\n\nHogwarts Legacy is amazing. But it does have its cons.\nI was kind of disappointed (minor gameplay spoiler here) [spoiler] when I found out there was no quidditch. I definitely hoped this would be a part of the game. [/spoiler] There are also a lot of collectibles. And I mean tons of collectibles. A good amount of these are locked behind some really repetitive challenges. So be aware of this. This could be a plus for some people, but I thought it was a little too much. (So heads up for the achievement hunters out there, you have to collect all of these for 100%) \n", "timestamp_created": 1677689129, "timestamp_updated": 1677689129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133868180": {"recommendationid": "133868180", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074933339", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 456, "playtime_at_review": 456, "last_played": 1677688629}, "language": "english", "review": "Grew up with the Harry Potter series.

The game has the majority of concepts you've seen in movies and read in books. The spells have great implementations, fighting is very pleasant, and the environment is brilliant: interiors look like magic, and the castle is just beyond my expectations. The world does feel like it's from a magical universe. Overall in all aspects the game is decent. It's not excellent, but it's decent and I would recommend to play it. It is definitely worth the money.\nHowever, I'd like to leave a list of things that might become a deal breaker for you:\n\n- Performance and overall quality is really bad. This is not only about generally low framerate, but also about weird occasional lag spikes, freezes, fps drops in cutscenes, etc. The game is swarming with bugs that sometimes don't let you start/finish missions, and it becomes really annoying. Not like they are everywhere, but as soon as you encounter bugs, you will definitely remember those unpleasant moments of experience.\n\n- Main quest is garbage. The quest lets you discover a form of magic called \"ancient magic\", which has no relation to the movie or the book implementation of the world, so it's supposed to be a kind of new type of magic. And the bad thing is that the game fails to explain what kind of a magic it is. All you can learn is that one wielding it, can build nice architecture, change weather, and grow plants. You can also take people's pain, at a particular cost (that you will see in the game). Is that enough to explain the nature of such magic? Clearly no. The only way you can use this \"ancient magic\" as a character, is to throw objects into enemies (and I have no idea why it's called \"ancient magic throw\"), and cast a strike onto an enemy with a lot of damage. You can basically take out any enemy with such a strike, but it'll take some time to recharge. Mini-bosses and bosses will need 2 or more strikes. And that's it, you're just left with these two mechanics, without any knowledge of where this magic comes from, and why the heck you need it.\nThe other part of the main quests is spinning around an evil goblin named Ranrok, who literally: wants to find boundless power and make the world bow to him. Such a cliche, with no taste in it. If Voldermort had some basic ideas that kinda look like fascism, and Grindelwald wanted to ruin the iron curtain between the wizzards and the muggles, then Ranrok simply wants to find a source of limitless power to just... rule over wizzards? Lame. Besides, all quests in the game, which are related to Ranrok, mainly include fights, nothing else. So you just run around, smash goblins and do small quizzes.\nSide quests from Poppy (because you get to help animals, who doesn't like that? :D) and Sebastian (will teach you Imperio, Crucio, and Avada Kedavra) have way way way more interesting quests with more diverse game mechanics than the main quest, even though these two are quite short. Maybe you'll like Natty's quest as well.\n\n- Hogwarts staff is lame af. Neither of the professors stays in your memory. Maybe it was a case for the movies, because they span across multiple hours, so you kind of feel anxious for them, but in the game you simply have no reason to give a monkey's left nut: they just walk around the castle and don't talk much. There's nothing that binds you with the professors and develops any feelings to them. The most disappointing was the Hogwarts' headmaster: a guy who has absolutely no clue how to manage the castle and its dwellers. Everyone complains about him, and he annoys you throughout the entire walkthrough. I was expecting some kind of a wise old man who knows what he's doing, but instead got this wanker. Professor Fig isn't less lame, because most of the time he's like \"hmmmm, I wonder\", \"hmmmm, strange...\". \"hmmm, what does that mean?\". Wasn't he supposed to be more wise and powerful than the main character?\n[spoiler]Besides, the guy dies in the end of the main quest for no fucking reason at all. A second ago he was helping to hold a giant rock mid-air, and now he's crippling and fucking dying. I suppose the game expected the players to develop some feelings to professor Fig, and by killing him, triggering some emotions. But no, the game doesn't make the professor unique enough. He did nothing to make me regret his unexpected death. That just looks silly.[/spoiler]\n\n- The game lacks proper cut-scenes. Most of the time you will be looking at characters as they speak, from two angles, and the characters won't be doing anything with their bodies, hands, legs, just talking. Feels like the developers just didn't have money for cut-scenes for all quests, not even the main one.\n\n- If you're done with the main quest and side quests (Sebastian, Poppy, and Natty) - you're basically done with the game too. There's no point in exploring the world, since all aspects of the game's universe are covered by the main quest and those three I've enumerated. You can of course go and purge all bandit camps, but that's only if you really like fighting. By the end of the game they will become too easy and bland. All caves and ruins are almost identical. The worst thing is that after finishing the game, you're presented with loot chests, that don't offer you anything of value. Very soon you become strong enough to just ignore all of them, because you don't need them. That ruins the point of exploring caves and castles. This balance problem makes it boring to wander around and explore the world. Probably the only interesting thing left are treasure hunts with maps. They do have some interesting quizzes. Exploring the castle in this case also becomes quite boring, since there's nothing hidden or new, that you haven't seen in the movie. Occasional chests with useless loot is the maximum.\n\n- The game presents you with combat plants, however, I personally didn't find any use for them. You can buy them in stores, which is kinda okay, if you're a loot nerd and pick everything you can see (useless clothing can be sold for good money). Or, you can grow these plants, which is quite tedious. Besides, they don't give you much advance in combat.\n\n- The game reacts to your dialog and spell choices in absolutely no way, with the exception of a faculty (gryffindor, slytherin, and so on). If you want to play as a really dark wizard - forget about it. Nobody will give a damn if you use unforgivable curses all the time, even in front of a professor. You also can't kill friendly or passive npcs, or animals. This point was a major drawback for me personally. I really did want to see the relationships change based on how I acted in combat and dialogs.\n\nHope I helped!", "timestamp_created": 1677687747, "timestamp_updated": 1677687747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133867109": {"recommendationid": "133867109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071098880", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1428, "playtime_at_review": 3035, "last_played": 1677088315}, "language": "english", "review": "You can be a wizard, or witch, for only 59.99!!", "timestamp_created": 1677687556, "timestamp_updated": 1677687556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133866740": {"recommendationid": "133866740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085223046", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 205, "playtime_at_review": 1042, "last_played": 1677697922}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well designed and thought out.

I\u2019m enthused about the combat system; it\u2019s a mix of Souls-like and a combinatory casting system so far unheard-of. And the idea of the Room of Requirement is genius and lots of fun! As to me, it is enough to roam the wizarding world, whose spirit has been exceptionally well captured, and seek out and knock down enemies, to give the game an overall positive rating.\n\nHowever, I think there are lots of conceptual drawbacks and game design decisions, which I seriously mourn. With alterations, the game could have been so much more.\n\nThese include:\n\nPointless night/day cycles and lifeless NPCs are my number one immersion buster. In the beginning, I did not imagine NPCs without scripted routines necessarily a bad thing. The way it\u2019s implemented in Hogwarts Legacy, it is. Regardless of the time of the day, you run into a shop and receive a cheerful welcome from the always available, smiling merchant, at your service. At \u2013 supposedly - 0300 in the night. Given that you can have an instant nap on the floor and swap day/night at any time, it wouldn\u2019t have been a hassle to make the shopping system more believable.\n\nThen, isn\u2019t there a curfew at night? Every now and then NPCs debate about it. Despite one rather flimsy sneaking mission, the curfew is completely omitted. You run free around the castle at any given hour unhampered by anything and anyone. Surely some ghosts or at least Peeves could tell on you. Nothing. Run into the forbidden section of the library with a roar. Infiltrate the teachers\u2019 quarters at night and do a little dancey around them standing lifelessly in the middle of the room. Break into some poor family\u2019s home to find them enjoying a posh cupper after midnight while you perform a tap dance on their table. Not to speak of looting all their belongings right in front of their eyes. Seriously?!\n\nWhat\u2019s most disappointing to me is the world itself being unaffected by night/day- or it\u2019s so minor that it has slipped me. Isn\u2019t the forbidden forest a dreadful location spreading fear among students and grown witches and wizards alike? Quite on the contrary, do your little joy walk in the forest at any time of the day and stay unimpressed by the occasional handful of spiders. Even the centaurs roaming the forest are completely unresponsive to you, even if you cast some crucio up their ****. I remember my accelerating heartbeat when, years ago, in Ocarina of Time sundown was close and I was running for my life to reach the drawbridge, before it would lock me out with the night horrors. If you dared take a step off the roads, doom arose from the ground around you. In Hogwarts Legacy, nothing like that, the world wants to please, not challenge you.\n\nSomewhere I read that it was a conscious design decision to omit a morality system. To me, frankly, it sounds like an excuse for an approaching release deadline. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense, if you, while being head-over-heels in a fight with dark wizards together with your caring mentor or some innocent school mate, surprise them with a crucio out of your pocket and they give you the same demented look as they always do. Come on, they\u2019re unforgivable, please send me to Azkaban for this! Likewise, so far, I did not see any obvious effect of the choice of dialogue options. Be it the friendly or more rough option, the dialogue always seems to continue in a diplomatic way, advancing the quest in a one-dimensional way. My opinion on this is preliminary, as I haven\u2019t yet completed my first playthrough; maybe there\u2019s the big reveal and day of reckoning in the end? I doubt it, though, but will be happy to update my review if I\u2019m proven wrong.\n\nAlso, a very big deal to me is the overall difficulty of the game. I started off in normal mode, so I\u2019m hoping for a spicier experience once I switch to hard difficulty. As for now, in my 50 or so hours of gameplay, I might have died a handful of times- usually because I took a clumsy step and fell off a cliff. Enemies don\u2019t pose a challenge. Usually you run into a dungeon \u2013 well, dungeons don\u2019t really exist, rather small caves with hardly any ramifications \u2013 obliterate every soul that\u2019s inside, interact with something, and track back out. The lack of challenging fights goes hand in hand with brainless puzzles: with Revelio you see what\u2019s interactable, you interact, done. Sometimes you need to push a crate, rotate a portal or whatever, but it\u2019s almost offensive how little thinking and trying is required to solve a puzzle. And on top of that, my character doesn\u2019t even leave a any chance of making my own thoughts: usually within the first second after approaching a puzzle, the character tips off the full explanation about how to proceed. Such a killjoy! Other games at least leave you the choice whether or not you want a hint. Also a big bummer: bosses \u2013 in terms of looks and attack patterns - seem super uninspired.\n\nAnd lastly: invisible walls and you-cant-do-that-stuff everywhere! I fully understand that even an open (game) world needs restrictions to provide a smooth gaming experience. No dev wants every player easily glitch out of the map. But in Hogwarts Legacy, openness is a very generous term. Oftentimes you can\u2019t even walk behind huge statues, jump over tiny walls etc. There are other means to confine a world without breaking immersion! Look at Elden Ring, for example: if you\u2019re not meant to go somewhere, place an abyss or maybe enemies or traps way to tough for you to proceed. That gives incentive to explore! Not being able to climb the smallest rock because of invisible barriers is simply disheartening. Some restrictions of the game seem justified: being unable to unmount a broom in very narrow areas seems plausible. But why can\u2019t I land on the castle\u2019s roof? Gosh, put in some student nerd patrol that drags me to the headmaster if I do something frowned upon, but don\u2019t give me a \u201cyou can\u2019t do that\u201d message box! Argh!\n\nThis being said, it makes a lot of sense that not every area of the open world can be entered on a mount. Imagine the traffic chaos in Hogsmeade! But what\u2019s the deal with all the areas in the open wilderness that are surrounded by an impenetrable \u201cmagic barrier\u201d? Of course, I tried to get on top of the highest mountain as soon as I got my broom. Why the hell not! Why, then, is there a barrier preventing me from doing that? Did the devs lack time to finish this part of the map? In Breath of the Wild, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that at first due to lacking climbing skills and stamina, or because I\u2019m dressed inappropriately for the chills in higher areas. Very believable restriction! But like this? Shame!\n\nAch, I forgot- the fast travel system is way overdone. Virtually every few meters you stumble across a fast travel station- who got them installed in the depth of the wilderness? Since you can access fast traveling from the map at any given time (you don\u2019t even need to seek out the next travel station), you find yourself hopping from node to node and continue your rather short walk from there. Kills every incentive to explore. Makes using your mount most of the time pointless. I think I only once left or entered Hogwarts by feet- I have seriously no idea how the castle connects with the rest of the world, let alone the insides of this otherwise masterpiece of game art design. Such a pity! I know, why don\u2019t I just walk? Well, because sometimes I\u2019m as well attracted toward short-term-solutions and appreciate incentive.\n\nReading through my review, the emphasis on criticism makes it look like there\u2019s more cons than pros to this game- it is not! The game design has a lot of beauty and novelty and a lot to offer!\n\nHowever, to me it\u2019s rather a wizarding world travel and socializing simulator, than an adventure.\n", "timestamp_created": 1677679868, "timestamp_updated": 1677679868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133860696": {"recommendationid": "133860696", "author": {"steamid": "76561199311994957", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3070, "playtime_at_review": 4784, "last_played": 1677698267}, "language": "english", "review": "Tons of content to play.

It really feels new and different from many games that are already out there and really threw me for a loop even if I had quite high expectations for this game.\nThe combat is great. The environment is beautiful. The characters you meet and befriend are likable, relatable and most of the time interesting. The mechanic with taking care of beasts almost had me in tears the first time I walked into the vivarium,\n\nBUT! And there is a big but. There is a reason I do not give this game 10/10. \nFirst off...In the beginning and middle of the game your character feels REALLY... Mary Sue ish... Your character goes to learn a spell, learns it on the first try and everyone is in awe. I mean really compliments you like you are Jesus born anew. You go to retrieve something at the bottom of a lake. Have you ever dove before? No? Everyone is in awe of your ability to be able to dive so well on the first try. At beast class you pretty much befriend all beasts by looking at them etc etc. Your character is SO perceptive and intelligent and can do no wrong. It kind of ticked me off to be honest. \n\nAlso the fact that it felt like the developers already had a character in mind for this story, how they would act what they would be like etc. The only thing you really control are some choices, what your character look like and whether this character is an ahole or not. I mean what if my character love spiders? Pretty much every time when you defeat spiders the main character comments how much they hate spiders. What if I want my character to be more like Hagrid? \nAnd I wanted my character to be an all loving beast freak and it felt like my character was not allowed to because the developers already had put up a frame of what my character should be like. \n\nThe Mary Sue thing gets better by the end portion of the game but God I almost wanted to punch all characters that treated me like a messiah. I mean I know the chosen one trope is kind of a given but the chosen one can have layers, make mistakes etc. Just take Mass Effects commander Shepherd. \n\n*SPOILER ALERT*I mean commander Shepherd fails a couple of missions, and he sucks at dancing, not everyone agrees with his decisions and sometimes for good reasons, he even has to work with the bad guy for a while and he is still \"the chosen one\" with a lot of skills etc. And you still feel like you can mold commander Shepherd into what character you wish for him or her to be like. So Id have like more choices for your character.\n\nThen we have the mini games... Or specifically the alohomora mini game...Guys seriously... Alohomora is supposed to be a convenient spell that opens doors quickly... Who thought it was a brilliant idea to make a mini game for a spell that is supposed to be the most practical and convenient spell?! I mean it is not a hard mini game and it does not take up much time but when you have to go through that mini game to open 50 different doors it gets old pretty fast... And again the spell is supposed to be the most practical and convenient spell and you just managed to make it tedious as f to use.... I sighed every time I had to unlock a bloody door.\n\nThen we have the Merlin trials...I actually really liked them. I really really liked the concept and thought it was fun before I found out I would have to do them almost 100 times if I wanted to complete them all. Seeing as I like to complete as much as possible in any game I play, something I liked and enjoyed quickly turned into another thing I sighed about every time I saw that leaf icon pop up everywhere I went. I get it you don't have to do all of them. But it still bugged me that they could not have implemented some of these challenges into the game without needing to do them almost hundred times to complete them all.\n\nThe story is also really nothing special. It is not bad by any means and they could have done way worse on that front. It is fine and somewhat creative but not a story I will remember for years to come type of deal.\n\nHaving said all that I still love love LOVE this game. It is a magical experience to say the least. The magic that is implemented in the exploration aspect is so much fun and everything in this game is simply wonderful and feels magical (except the things I mentioned above.) The quests never got boring and the side quests themselves where a joy to play through, exploring the world and Hogwarts for hours was a wonder and delight and just yeah.

I very much enjoy it and do recommend it, especially to fans of the Wizarding World. However, there are a few things I feel could greatly improve the game, at least in my opinion. \n\nSpoilers ahead of course, so be warned.\n\nAs much as I like open-world games, I feel like it was unnecessary for this game outside of Hogwarts. Exploring the castle, Hogsmeade and Forbidden Forest was perfect, but I feel the rest of the map wasn't needed. It was my thought that as students we were confined to the castle grounds for our own safety, so exploring outside of it (out of curfew hours might I add) seemed extremely reckless considering our character is literally being hunted by Goblins, poachers and dark wizards. I did find exploring the wider world cool on my initial playthrough but after I found it to be tedious and mostly didn\u2019t bother apart from to do side quests. There are far too many Merlin trials and collectables out in the world that are so repetitive and give you nothing but an achievement for completing so felt very pointless. Exploring Hogwarts was definitely a treat and I loved finding places I had forgotten about or were new to me. The only downside was that it would have been more immersive to have prefects and professors roaming the corridors at night making us have to sneak past them. But other than that I wouldn\u2019t change it.\n\nAs for classes themselves, they were fun the first time because they had mini-games of sorts, but that was it. After that is just a quick cutscene. They could have done it like in Bully, where you get two classes a day to attend and play a mini-game, and depending on how well you do will determine your score. Just look at the potions mini-game in the Half Blood Prince game. It could even contribute to our O.W.Ls at the end of the year. And lastly make it so we have to attend a few before we learn a new spell from the professors, so it actually seems like we\u2019re attending school.\n\nWhen it comes to fellow students and professors I feel like we didn\u2019t get as much time with them as we should have. We had one initial class with the professors then were given a couple of assignments to complete to learn new spells but that was it. Apart from Fig, they weren\u2019t really included in the story, which I found disappointing as I like them all. And considering two of those professor\u2019s were an ex-auror and an unspeakable, our character would have been way more prepared to face Ranrok if they had been in-the-know instead of us having to do everything ourself. Even our fellow students, who we help with their own quests, don\u2019t come with us. It would have been cool if after helping them they would all come with us on our quests, each with their own unique skill. Despite being classmates before we came along they never seem to interact with each other at all. Would have been cool to have our own little group like Harry, Ron and Hermione.\n\nLastly, a morality system. Having dialogue options did basically nothing other than kind-of-but-not-really show your personality, but even then our character is pretty much always good. Would have been cool to have personality dialogue like in the Dragon Age games. There are no consequences for your actions which makes it a little boring. If they had introduced a points system it would have made it interesting trying to stay out of trouble. Even at the end of the game after you have made a few choices, there is little to no mention of them.\n\nThere are probably a few things I\u2019ve forgotten to mention but those are the main things I feel could have made a big difference for me. Overall I do like the game and hope we get a sequel or some DLC in future to improve it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1677673394, "timestamp_updated": 1677673394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133855903": {"recommendationid": "133855903", "author": {"steamid": "76561199090386467", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1853, "playtime_at_review": 2858, "last_played": 1677685192}, "language": "english", "review": "As a Harry Potter lover I literally got goosebumps while playing this game.

It is a great game, but there are too many missed opportunities for it to be a \"once in a decade\" game. It is more action adventure than action RPG.\n\nThere is this beautifully detailed world with a impressive art style and intriguing mystical music. You'll have plenty of things to do and many places to discover. The story is intriguing, many characters have depth and the Room of Requirements is one of the best features I ever discovered in my gaming years. The combat is fun and you can combine spells in many ways to find your personal fighting style. Also, there is the possibility to reduce the amount of UI - which I appreciate. The graphics are great and clothing customization is just top notch!\n\nHowever, many environments (dungeons, camps) and game mechanics are reused way to often (Merlin Trials, Alohomora Puzzles, Collectibles, Scripted Events, ...). Don't get me wrong, all mechanics are fun at the beginning, but this wears of rather quickly. You have the choice to ignore repeating elements and I would recommend you to do it. It mostly isn't worth it to grind them - I found they are most fun when stumbling upon them on occasion.\n\nYou want to feel part of Hogwarts? Well, after initial exploration it feels like a staged scenery: You can't sit anywhere, you can't sleep in the common room (which really has no relevance after the beginning), there is no house rivalry, you don't attend classes besides for missions. Also, the \"RPG\" elements don't suffice for me to feel connected to the world. They should have focused on more immersion rather than a large world map with dozens of bandit camps. The game would provide a solid basis for that.\n\nNow, some bullet lists!\n\nWhat could have been:\n- More immersion, smaller world (Classes, Morality System, Penalties, House Competition,...). It does not have to be a full on simulator for that: Look at Bully and Shadow of Mordor\n- Actual character development (e.g. Disco Elysium)\n- Using Dark Arts should have an impact on how people react to you\n- More choices that matter, feeling that they have an impact and consequences (less linearity)\n- More depth to the Goblin Rebellion and the choice to side with them\n- More sophisticated potion brewing (e.g. Kingdom Come Deliverance)\n- Having companions outside missions\n- End game content\n- NG+\n- Overall, the main character should be less godly (you can not make any mistakes, your character does everything perfectly and this is also communicated in dialogues)\n\nHow to improve Quality of Life:\n- Less repeating voice lines (e.g. floo powder, discovering trials / dungeons, visiting Hogsmeade)\n- Mark items in inventory to bulk sell them at vendors\n- Be able to look up and down when flying\n- Being able to sell potions and ingredients\n- Skip Alohomora puzzles with a higher level Alohomora spell", "timestamp_created": 1677669910, "timestamp_updated": 1677690418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133853988": {"recommendationid": "133853988", "author": {"steamid": "76561199442832214", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1297, "playtime_at_review": 1411, "last_played": 1677680197}, "language": "english", "review": "Good shit brah", "timestamp_created": 1677669811, "timestamp_updated": 1677669811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133853956": {"recommendationid": "133853956", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992764875", "num_games_owned": 2575, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 5631, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3457, "playtime_at_review": 5631, "last_played": 1677620659}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr:\n7/10 - must buy if you're a fan of the Wizzarding world, wait for a sale if you're not. \n\nThe wizzarding world was the constant franchise of early 2000's. For people like me who went to middle school around the time the books and movies were released, it was a pop culture phenomenon. It was everywhere, you read the books, saw the movies, played those early EA video game adaptations back when they were good. And after the 8th movie came out you were around the same age as the characters, you were done with school and heading out into the real world. This franchise means a lot to the 'millennial' generation and I'd say Avalanche has done a great job capturing what made the franchise so special all those years ago, while still taking into account that the target audience isn't twelve anymore.\n\nFans of the franchise will love this game. Hogwarts has everything you'll recognize from the movies, and even stuff from the books that never made it to the silver screen. The smallest things, like the potion ingredient store closet or the jail cell on the roof they kept Sirius Black in for all of 2 seconds in the third movie. The House Elf kitchens and the ghost ballroom from the books, they're all there for you to discover. It's a nostalgia trip and that alone is worth the price of admission, IF you are a fan.\n\nAvalanche has done everything it can to make this game appeal to all, unfortunately they listened to the twitter side of the internet for what would appeal to them. The response this game has gotten online is nothing short of hilarious, the very people this game is made for are trying all that they can to stop people from playing it. Their whims are being catered to at every turn. From the for 1790's Scotland laughably diverse student body and faculty, merchants and townsfolk, to the sexuality of every side character seemingly being non-straight. You'd think they'd eat this game up, but no. I hope that sends a message to the industry that you can not please these people. \n\nFor people less familiar with the source material, or those who never really cared that much, this game must seem a bit mid. When you get out of Hogwarts you are greeted with a massive overworld that is completely littered with useless stuff. Mostly consisting of what are called Merlin trials, which require you to do a tedious little puzzle to trigger an animation. This gets you inventory upgrades, so you'll have to do at least a few, but there a dozens of these menial things everywhere. \nAs well as the caves, which are all copy pasted from the same handful of templates and get you nothing other than a piece of gear which is always worse than what you already have. You can completely ignore these but they will always clutter up your compass, map and minimap.\n\nCombat is simple and can be trivialized with potions and plants, I finished the whole thing challenge dungeons and all on normal difficulty but it never actually got difficult. Maybe that changes on higher difficulties, but the combat isn't what makes this game worth playing anyway.\n\nThis game shines in it's presentation, like I said, if you are a fan of the wizzarding world you will love this game. But it doesn't quite capture the (pardon the phrasing) magic of going to a magic school and having your own adventure. I think most of that is to do with the lack of interaction with your classmates. You do your main adventure mostly on your own being aided only by a professor. Your classmates are relegated to side quests, which I think is a shame. Because what connected the audience to the story of the books and movies was building this bond with new friends and together becoming stronger than any adversary. Here you are the chosen one who could've done it all by themselves.\nPortkey games has this phone game 'Hogwarts Mystery' that does that way better. I hope they decide to port that to PC in some from or another now that this is such a rousing success.  \n\nWho you are in this game is vague, your origins are not revealed. Who are you? Why are you only joining Hogwarts as a fifth year? Where do you come from? It seems there's a prelude missing and kind of an important one. \nThe choices you make along the way also don't matter to the story one bit.  \n\nAvalanche clearly want you to spend the bulk of your time in Hogwarts. You get a whole room all to yourself for you to interact with animals, build the perfect pen for them. Create your own space decorated to your liking, you can sink hours into just that if you wanted to. \n\nTechnically it runs well enough. It runs on the Unreal 4 engine, so there's still pop-in everywhere when you're outside zipping through the map on a broom. It also does a small frame drop every time you charge into a different area of the overworld map. Inside Hogwarts that all goes away. It does have to load a second or two at doors at times still though. So you can see the seams in this seamlessly connected world, but they didn't really bother me.\nEnemy AI is single minded and dumb, when you blast someone of a platform or just remove them far enough from their path, they have to run all the way back to where they started. They won't attack you during their little hike until they get there. None of them will ever dodge out of the way.\n\nThe amount of content here is nothing to sneeze at, and considering the success of this game I'd be surprised if Warner Bros. didn't come out with some cut content as DLC. There's a screenshot of a dragon on this very storepage that is just not in this game. The made character models fro dementors that are only used in one cutscene for one Hufflepuff specific quest in Azkaban. We only hear about stuff happening in the ministry. Definitely room for expansion.\n\nFor fans of franchise this is an absolute must-buy. For everyone else, you should probably wait for a sale. It's a fun romp, but like I said, without the nostalgia trip it loses a lot of it's appeal.", "timestamp_created": 1677669753, "timestamp_updated": 1677669753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52702707052230835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133853954": {"recommendationid": "133853954", "author": {"steamid": "76561199481315241", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 928, "playtime_at_review": 928, "last_played": 1677637835}, "language": "english", "review": "its an adventure", "timestamp_created": 1677669750, "timestamp_updated": 1677669750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133853929": {"recommendationid": "133853929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031398187", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 521, "playtime_at_review": 447, "last_played": 1677698017}, "language": "english", "review": "", "timestamp_created": 1677669708, "timestamp_updated": 1677669708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133853665": {"recommendationid": "133853665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084504141", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5088, "playtime_at_review": 5334, "last_played": 1677668785}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality game 9.5/10.

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them.

I\u2019m used to playing games but the combat and nuisances in the game made it special.

So I do recommend this game if you are starting out or want to try out the genre. However, I will say it was too easy. The game did not feel difficult because the mobs felt repetitive and the story felt predictable.\n\nLuckily, I am a completionist and was able to 100% all the challenges, main story and side-quests. Albeit it took me 50 in game hours, I still enjoyed the art, characters and objectives.\n\nYou maybe thinking why i have more than 50 hours played? But only 50 are in game. The rest were from loading screens, booting up the game and fixing settings, etc. Performance issues were horrible. I played all in low settings and 30 fos capped and I still had frame rates drop and lag from time to time.

This game is set in the late 1800s, and the entire plot revolves around a mysterious power that you (the character) wields and the goblin rebellion that has been terrorising the wizarding world. \n\nIt is an open world concept, so very BOTW-like. Only difference being your weapons don't break (obviously). As you progress in the game, you get to rear and cultivate your own plants and even beasts/animals that you can keep in the Room of Requirement.\n\nLocations in the game like the Room of Requirement and even the locations of the common rooms are very spot on. Even way before I am able to access the Room of Requirement, I already had an inkling of where it is when I happened to pass by a large painting of a man teaching trolls how to dance on the seventh floor. And when I went exploring around the school, I found the locations of the other three common rooms (I'm in Ravenclaw), though obviously, I can't access it. But the locations are very spot on.\n\nConversations between NPCs too tells you more of the world than what is told to you. There is one occasion when I entered a classroom only to witness a student being told off by a Howler which adds some humor to it.\n\nYou can also explore Hogsmeade and befriend the villagers and even do side quests for them.\n\nThe only complaint (not really complain) that I have, is that there doesn't seem to be a curfew for our character at all. I can still explore the school at night, and there doesn't seem to be any consequences whatsoever. \n\nCombat too is very straight forward. You sling spells at your opponents and could put up shields and dodge. Though I almost had a heart attack the first time I came face to face with a group of Inferi which gave me lots of unwanted flashbacks to when I was watching a friend play Resident Evil. Setting them on fire has never felt so satisfying before.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 10/10, and it definitely has replay value, not unlike Skyrim. Hoping the devs will include Quidditch playing in a DLC though.\n\nI played this game on the Steam Deck, and it runs perfectly, tho I need to set the resolution so that screenshots I took actually looks good.", "timestamp_created": 1677647662, "timestamp_updated": 1677647662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133842863": {"recommendationid": "133842863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198930619526", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 455, "playtime_at_review": 1455, "last_played": 1677661471}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1677647617, "timestamp_updated": 1677647617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133842850": {"recommendationid": "133842850", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971557606", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 3993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2145, "playtime_at_review": 3993, "last_played": 1677457595}, "language": "english", "review": "Much better than I thought it would be.

It's quite pretty, it's UI is good, it's well optimised, and some of its missions and characters are quite appealing. It's also got good aesthetic choices regarding the fashion so you can - if you want - be incredibly anal about what you choose to wear though you'll look mostly look either very stupid or very out of place if you don't dress like a normal Hogwarts student.\n\nit's not perfect though. For one it's not even remotely immersive. 1800s Britain was not flooded with foreigners and even today it's rather rare to find them in the Scottish Highlands of all places. The combat is easy and there are very few enemy types. The dungeons are incredibly repetitive. The dialogue makes it feel like the side quests are open and non-linear but they are - in fact - incredibly linear. The loot is universally useless given the combat is too easy to demand stat hunting and the equipment is all skins with stats attached. The rest of the loot is miscellaneous crap for decorating your room. House choice doesn't matter at all apart from aesthetics. The Forbidden Forest is basically just an area and doesn't really distinguish itself much. Your crusade to 'save' all the animals is pretty much just a nicer version of poaching. The only worthwhile mount is the broom and most broom skins suck ass. \n\nGets an upvote because it's fun to play through the story but don't expect 100% ing this game to be anything but very tedious.

The devs could have easily coasted on the Harry Potter IP and made a game that tons of people would pay for, but chose to make a truly rich, deep game with tons to explore. PC performance is a bit too inconsistent to not mention, though. Thankfully, the performance during the most important parts was great. I would get a rock solid 120 FPS during major battles, but then drop to a stuttery, inconsistent 40-50 FPS (with clear frame drops regularly) during some overworld tasks or in seemingly basic, enclosed spaces like stairwells. Seems like the devs put a ton of attention into getting performance right where it mattered, but it's a bit disappointing that areas that would seem on the surface to be extremely easy to render have less than half the FPS of other areas. I suspect in time this will be fixed, but for now it is something to keep in mind. Regardless, if you don't have more than 16GB RAM, don't even consider playing this at 1080p or higher, even with DLSS at ultra performance mode. This is truly a \"next gen\" game in the sense that it is totally unplayable on old hardware.\n\nThe performance issues are extremely easy to ignore however, because the game is fantastic.

The castle is just filled to the brimm with charm with small details sprinkled all over the place.

Personally the weakest part of the graphics were the character models I feel as while they are detailed I felt lacked in expression sometimes and  were also a little buggy. Not to mention some textures like their could seem a little off.\nThere is loads of customizability not just in the player character themselves but also in other aspects and I absolutely loved it.\nDecsisions made however felt a bit lacking as most usually had the same outcome with small bits of different dialouge. And Animations by characters while in talking cut scenes both by player character and NPC, could at times feel stiff and out of place. For instance, the player character seemed to have only a small handful of animations they used while they spoke to express their body language and some of them felt way to repetativ with how much they were used.\nBut overall, I had a blast with my first playthrough and am eagerly starting my second soon as I purposely avoided doing everything the first go around to make playing in a different house a little more uniqe.", "timestamp_created": 1677642361, "timestamp_updated": 1677642361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133840050": {"recommendationid": "133840050", "author": {"steamid": "76561199480599123", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2010, "playtime_at_review": 1991, "last_played": 1677642337}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1677642331, "timestamp_updated": 1677642331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133840012": {"recommendationid": "133840012", "author": {"steamid": "76561199229174781", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1664, "playtime_at_review": 1796, "last_played": 1677642161}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a really fun game with a big open world aspect.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Make a wizard or witch, explore the entire castle to your satisfaction, cast a bunch of spells  (including the unforgivable curses) and save the wizarding world from a big threat.\n\nI do have a few complaints. Mainly that the characters and your relationships with them seem pretty superficial overall. A few standouts (Sebastian and Poppy) really add to the world but overall it's somewhat hard for me to find real investment. Example: a friend of mine asked me which professor was my favorite and I really struggled with finding a reason to pick one over the others.\n\nA related complaint is the lack of depth to character relationships. Several lines from NPCs gives me the impression that romance may have been intended at one point, but was abandoned. Though I can't be sure of that, the relationships you form do seem to be pretty shallow.\n\nQuests likewise lack a meaningful impact.\n\nBut this game really shines in exploration and having the world feel like a completely natural translation and expansion of the universe. I especially like some touches like moving the Slytherin sink (the entrance to the chamber of secrets) bathroom to a location that fits the books more accurately, while keeping the exact look from the movie. The entire world feels like a true representation of Hogwarts, and the wizarding communities that surround it.\n\nI disagree with some of the decisions they've made here, and while I love the characters, I wish interactions and relationships with them felt more meaningful.

There are some points that I think could have had a bit more thought behind it.\n1.  Common room - it would have been nice to have more reasons to go back to the common room besides the chest.\n2. Sneaking around - it would have been nice if we did have to sneak around at night rather than just getting to run around without any issue.\n3. Broom - it is very difficult to look around while you are on your broom.  It would have been nice to be able to look around while you were on your broom.\n4. Loot - it would have been nice to have more than just gear in the chests, maybe new potion recipes or items for upgrades or even maps to other locations.\n5. NPC(s) - Being able to interact more with the other students maybe have them react to the things you are doing or have done.\n6. Consequences - having your actions truly affect the world around you would have added a bit more depth.\n7. No character background - Your character feels more like an NPC given there is no history, nothing at all about where they came from, or anything.  Maybe even a short story board that allows you to decide what you are. Pure blood, muggle born or whatever.  This would have allowed us to connect more to the characters.\n\nEven with these things I do love the game, I love finding everything, working through all the side quests.  I don't rush to end game.

There are a few idioms that characters use that contain setting-specific creatures I was unfamiliar with, but other than that, I felt the game did a good job of keeping me in the loop. Portkey Games has done a wonderful job in making the game feel fantastical, down to small touches like the animation of picking up potion ingredients in the world, and it's made me interested in finally getting around to the Harry Potter series.\n\nThe story is rather average - While I didn't get invested enough to care too much about most of the characters, I wasn't bored either. The beginning of the game is a slight bit slow, but once the game opens up a bit and lets you explore, there's enough freedom to feel free to explore the world and side missions, and forget about the story for a bit. Exploration is a treat for a good while, but a fair few become repetitive due to little variety. However, they typically aren't too tedious. Perhaps the story would be more fulfilling if I were a big fan of the franchise, but it's solid enough that I didn't mind.\n\nThe combat is simple to pick up, but remains enjoyable through to the end. The sixteen combat spells are more than enough to provide a solid arsenal, and the pace feels on the faster side. Unfortunately, there isn't any challenging content to test your skills once you've hit the maximum level and are geared out. With no DLC in the works, it doesn't seem like that'll change either. I played on normal difficulty, and didn't see much need to use potions or plants in combat, though hard difficulty might change that.\n\nFor all the plentiful praises that the game deserves though, there is plenty that could be improved upon, and I hope Portkey games takes lessons from it. The way gearing is handled is one of the more glaring ones, as it feels clunky. The number of inventory slots is oddly low, especially at the beginning of the game before you've had the chance to expand it, and even then it's not a huge improvement. Better gear mostly means more Offence or Defense stat, which isn't all too exciting. Upgrading gear simply ups these unexciting stats, and cost materials from the Room of Requirement, so some might not upgrade at all until they're replacing gear less often. Gear traits allow you to increase the damage of specific spells or increase your resistance against certain enemy types, but they give you no numbers to work with to give you a solid understanding. Significantly more damage for Diffindo? Great, but how much is \"significantly more\"?\n\nTLDR: Hogwarts Legacy has a fair few flaws, but the positives outweigh them by a large margin, and I would recommend giving it a try. I look forward to seeing the next project Portkey Games works on, and hope they can improve on the flaws from this game and build upon it going forward.", "timestamp_created": 1677633358, "timestamp_updated": 1677633358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133834456": {"recommendationid": "133834456", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996660843", "num_games_owned": 744, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 3972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3188, "playtime_at_review": 3538, "last_played": 1677664991}, "language": "english", "review": "Game made me hate trans people. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1677633188, "timestamp_updated": 1677633188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133834372": {"recommendationid": "133834372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153292958", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2004, "playtime_at_review": 1931, "last_played": 1677644719}, "language": "english", "review": "In a world of making half ass games with big names, this game meets muster; IT'S GREAT!

So far I've managed to basically do everything, and I can say with sure confidence that this was worth every dollars. The graphics and art design is awesome. I though the story was extremely lore friendly. I know some haven't enjoyed the combat mechanics, but I personally thought that the combat was excellent at expressing what a Wizard's duel might be like. The only downside is the spell limitation, but you can basically equip roughly 16 spells at a time. So, not bad. Finally, I really like how the game slips into cut scenes. Often it felt natural, although sometimes it felt rigid. Overall, I only wish that I could experience it all over again. Great game! Hope they eventually make more content or another game! Ha!\n\nPS\nOne special notice is the design of the torturing and killing curse. They both had the perfect mixture of sound and colour design to make it truly feel like you're playing as a Dark Wizard.\n\nPSS\nI think I can overlook the glitches I experience during the play-through considering they rarely came up and this game was only recently released.

I found the experience as clich\u00e9 as it is magical, I felt right at home when playing this game gripping me back into the wizarding world I've grown to love with the books and the movies! Avalanche Software have managed to capture both the books and the movies so well in all aspects from the incredibly interactive castle and easter eggs that aren't rubbed in your face and fit well into the environment they crafted (it held its own unique take too, the statues that got into a fight made me laugh. You can tell so much passion went into crafting Hogwarts and the surrounding areas are honestly really good however not on the level as Hogwarts, there is so much to explore and discover which I'll let you find out for yourself.\n\nThis game is everything I've always wanted from a Harry potter game bringing back so much nostalgia and memories there's nothing more i could of wanted. The sound and music design is impeccable while it's no John Williams it had it's own charm to it. The narrative was honestly for me rather enjoyable and for the most part really good, the side quests with the companions were really good and the main narrative while I thought was decent, did lack a little bit/speed through it while missing the opportunity to delve more into certain characters and motives and so on, but for what it was it didn't subtract from the experience and I enjoyed it a lot, I often found myself wondering off from the main quests for collectables and exploring, man the collectables and so on are awesome, gave me vibes of a lot of older games in that sense, still need to 100% them but so far enjoying finding them.\n\nThe gameplay was enjoyable, I found myself enjoying the gameplay loop for the combat and the crafting and so on (on normal mode) however I do think the gearing could of been fleshed out, felt a little to easy and gear felt meaningless as i progressed and got all my spells and talents. I enjoyed using potions and plants I had grown in herbology and potions while mixing it in with the core wand spell gameplay. \n\nSide note the transmorg system could use an option to save an outfit appearance instead of having to redo it manually everytime especially with all the constant new gear upgrades.\n\nThe room of requirement is honestly fantastic giving you your own space to customise and make yours while have LOADS of customisation options and crafting stuff, and the beast zoo's are wholesome, that whole system is such a fun side activity. The flying on the broom and mounts was great, took a bit of getting used to but afterwards I was able to re-enact\nharry on a broom or gliding along the black lake on my hippogriff. (Quidditch DLC pls)\n\nOn a side note I'd love to see future DLC added for story like the tri-wizard tournament or going under the black lake with the merpeople and so on, also a sequel going through the 6th and 7th year! Trading cards soon?\n\nOverall very happy with my gameplay experience here was well worth the purchase and am very happy to do so to support it. I would honestly give Hogwarts Legacy a 9/10, as I honestly loved it that much however there were a few issues for me, but nothing that took away from the experience, this has honestly been the best singleplayer game since Red dead 2 for me. I recommended it to all harry potter fans and those who haven't delved into this world it's defiantly worth it!

I pre-purchased this game before I was aware of that whole mess, and I seriously considered not playing the game once I did look into it. I'm still not very comfortable with my decision, but my love of the Wizarding World that JKR created and that hundreds (if not thousands) of other artists and craftspeople have brought to life outweighs my repulsion at the author's personal views. \n\nNow on to Hogwarts Legacy.

Everything that is in the game is well thought out and well executed. As a middle-aged guy whose reflexes are not what they once were, the combat system has just about the right amount of difficulty, I had to work at getting good, and I could still be better, and that's all exactly as it should be, IMHO. \n\nI'm aware that people have some performance issues, but the few that I've encountered (while playing at the High  graphics setting) are minimal - the occasional stutter or a bit of tearing. Your mileage may vary. Overall, though, I've found the game stable and breathtakingly beautiful. I frequently eschew Floo Powder for my broom or travel by foot, just to enjoy the scenery and the atmosphere.\n\nThe story is top-notch, as well. There is a bit of road-railing in a couple of the subplots, and I'd love to see more options in those and other areas, but I never expected Hogwarts Legacy to be a sandbox, anyway. (Though a sandbox rpg or mmo in the setting could be awesome!) Everything that happens in the game seems appropriate and logical, and all of the plots that I've played through so far have had satisfying development and conclusions.\n\nSo Hogwarts Legacy may not fulfill all of my dreams, but it does a great job of meeting my expectations, and I'm totally ready to purchase some DLC.", "timestamp_created": 1677627479, "timestamp_updated": 1677627856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133830735": {"recommendationid": "133830735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138551935", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4165, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4165, "playtime_at_review": 3785, "last_played": 1677649974}, "language": "english", "review": "This game would have an enjoyable story and play through without being based on the Harry Potter series.

The magic, the shops, all of hogwarts, the fiends, allies, beasts. It really sucks you right into the world.\n+ there are so many unique quests to enjoy with each a little story.\n+ fast travel points are always amazing, yet I rarely used them this game since running around is so much fun\n\n- I wish choices would actually matter and give us a different outcome. Sometimes I would make a choice and it would do what the other choice would have done.\n- on that topic, make relationships matter, right now it doesn't matter if you are kind or not. Make the decisions have consequences. Or just give us something showing the relationships we developed, good or bad.\n- there is so much multi-player potential (broom races, duelling, or even just stats). But none of it is used\n- the game keeps mentioning OWLs and I was hoping to do like little tests, quizzes etc (and maybe take the relationships you build into this too) and get an outcome of what you accomplished\n- a lot of repeating in the end. Mainly the merlin trials, it probably wouldn't be as bad if there  wasn't the same cutscene over and over.\n\nOther:\n1. I wish there was a picture function since the world is just so beautiful!\n\n2. I really do hope they change their minds on dlc's, there are so many possibilities to add!

There is iframe dodge rolling, shield parrying, color coded shield breaking, and a variety of spell effects that let you really feel like a proper mage with a variety of abilities at your command. There were only 2 moments where the game felt a little challenging and I purposefully died to restart that segment over and over because I was having so much fun!

This is a very good game, not without faults but solid overall. The story will keep you entertained for 32+ hours which in itself is a decent playtime. To me, it is easily worth a full price as it has already kept me entertained for a good amount of hours and I plan to grind some more completion percentage still. Keep in mind that not every game that comes out has to be a 10/10 or 1/10. Long story short, this is a perfectly fine 7/10, would recommend. \n\nAddressing the story first. I saw some complaints that it\u2019s foolish that we start as a 5th year wonderchild. What exactly is wrong with that? Yes, we are sort of a \u201cchosen one\u201d character but that applies to nearly every game, movie or book protagonist in a fantasy genre. Also, I do not think that grinding through early years of Hogwarts as an eleven year old learning leviosa all day would make a premium gameplay. Setting the story in 1800 was a great move. So refreshing to play a Potter game without references to you-know-who. You can focus on an original story and don\u2019t have to care about the books. As a drawback I would list that there was no morality system where using curses can actually have negative consequences. Casting Avada everywhere does not make anyone raise an eyebrow which is quite a shame.  Additionally our choices do not really matter all that much. Story sort of shows us why exactly are we special and is decent overall. Nothing spectacular just a fun, decent, entertaining story. \n\nMoving on, the combat. Spellcasting is extremely fun and satisfying. Keep in mind, this is not a Dark Souls game so it is pretty easy even on Hard. Combat is a casual yet fun experience with enemies being thrown, transmuted, ignited, slammed against the walls left and right. You can just fly to a bandit encampment and unleash hell. Fun and satisfying. Gear doesn\u2019t really matter all that much, it is mostly cosmetic, there are Defense and Offense stats but you can finish the game without giving these too much thought, just equip higher stat and move on. \n\nLastly, to keep this relatively brief, the world. There are basically two places in Hogwarts Legacy. The extremely alive, vibrant and well detailed Hogwarts and \u2026. rest of the world. The rest of the world is just there to feed us some bandits and side quests. While the visuals are stunning outside and there is magic in flying on a broom or a mount above a snowy countryside, the world outside of Hogwarts lacks depth. The stores are open at night and some people seem to be active 24/7, it is your usual sandboxy open yet not very detailed world. There are a lot of typical sandbox repetivie side quests and activities i.e. solve a puzzle, kill X, save X, go to X etc. Hogwarts castle, however, is a world in itself, with students, ghosts and portraits running amok and secret doorways around every corner. The level of details the Hogwarts represent is stunning. I\u2019ve already spent hours running around the castle just to explore and admire the effort the devs put into this part of the game. \n\nTo sum up, decent story, fun and satisfying combat, visually stunning both inside the Hogwarts castle and outside on the countryside.", "timestamp_created": 1677621990, "timestamp_updated": 1677621990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133826542": {"recommendationid": "133826542", "author": {"steamid": "76561199174148433", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3215, "playtime_at_review": 2795, "last_played": 1677697323}, "language": "english", "review": "amazinggg >_<", "timestamp_created": 1677621820, "timestamp_updated": 1677621820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133826503": {"recommendationid": "133826503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156837962", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 356, "playtime_at_review": 287, "last_played": 1677628279}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun", "timestamp_created": 1677621775, "timestamp_updated": 1677621775, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133826371": {"recommendationid": "133826371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090873602", "num_games_owned": 488, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 1305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 805, "playtime_at_review": 1305, "last_played": 1677535166}, "language": "english", "review": "Hmm I haven't found any hogs with warts yet.", "timestamp_created": 1677621608, "timestamp_updated": 1677621608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133826132": {"recommendationid": "133826132", "author": {"steamid": "76561199260277084", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2243, "playtime_at_review": 2546, "last_played": 1677626140}, "language": "english", "review": "bruh this shit fun ash", "timestamp_created": 1677621312, "timestamp_updated": 1677621312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133826118": {"recommendationid": "133826118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208972221", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2682, "playtime_at_review": 2589, "last_played": 1677630335}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1677621289, "timestamp_updated": 1677621289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133826111": {"recommendationid": "133826111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122643075", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7799, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4851, "playtime_at_review": 7799, "last_played": 1677621070}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a brilliant game.

The last boss, not the (SPOILERS) dragon, but the one before, it lasted 20 seconds at best, what a let down. Oh and TURN OFF the camera position aiming. It`s a nightmare. \n\nThe game looks great , sounds great. Gameplay is fantastic. I hope if they make another one, I wish they would improve on some stuff. There is room for for improvement.

Actually, that's not entirely true, I had 1 expectation which was that I wasn't going to play Hogwarts Legacy. And no, I didn't hold that expectation because I couldn't bear the thought of playing a game loosely based on the works of a bigot, it was due to the simple unavoidable fact that I do not care about Harry Potter. Despite watching every single 1 of the I don't know, 5? or so movies and reading half a book, I never truly got it. It's just a wee lad magicking around, presumably in his imagination as he needs to escape the hellscape of his living situation under his uncle's stairs. Add to this the LEGO Harry Potter games not being anywhere near as good (IN MY OPINION) as the excellent Star Wars and Indiana Jones games, I was left in no way hyped for this game, and yes I know this isn't a LEGO game, which honestly minus points. \n\nAfter apparently entering some sort of trance and adding this game to my wishlist and then watching a friend play through some of the early sections I decided to buy it. After owning the game for only 12 days, I already have over 60 hours and 100% of the achievements. You really wouldn't think I have a full time job. I know J.K Rowling is getting a lot of hate lately and rightfully so but thank fuck she decided that Hogwarts would be in Scotland. This game really wouldn't be the same if it were in England, granted some areas of the country could be made to look pretty great, the world we get to explore throughout this game is truly spectacular and incredibly well designed. Also, having gone to school in England I know first hand that the character who's eyes we experience this game through would actually just have been bullied the entirety of their first year after joining school late. Actually, that would probably happen in Scotland as well, going to have to mark that down as a severe inaccuracy within this game. Why are all the students so nice to someone who shows up a few years late to school and generally just nails everything? Every time I wake up in the dorm room, I am expecting another black eye or maybe a lewd drawing on my forehead, but no.\n\nAfter reading through the list of achievements, I expected I would need to complain about needing to reach the map room on all 4 houses, however as this only added an extra 3 hours of gametime, I didn't mind doing it, plus I got to do more Herbology lessons. Whilst on the topic of achievements, although I have no qualms with replaying the early levels, I really wish I didn't have to live through all of the Merlin Trials. Not because I found them too difficult, but due to the gall of Merlin forcing me to sit through 95 unskippable cutscenes. What a prick that man was, and truth be told I'm glad he's fucking dead. Even when I am stood on top of the centre of his little leaf outline, I do not appear in the cutscene, how self-important do you have to be? The world doesn't revolve around you Merlin, you fucking useless pile of bones, it revolves around the sun, maybe if you spent more time learning science instead of being a cunt you might have been able to notice that no one fucking likes you. At least I am only forced to see him being made out of leaves, because if I had to see his presumably hideous face NINETY FIVE times, I probably wouldn't have completed the game without prying out my eyes. Seriously, this guy makes me want an entire 9 hour storyline about the adventures of Peeves and Ignatia Wildsmith. That would be infinitely more enjoyable than hearing \"Not so tricky after all, Merlin\" one more fucking time.\n\nI don't know if it was hidden within the digital deluxe version that I didn't pay for or maybe it is in an upcoming DLC, but I couldn't seem to find Dogwarts. Did this get cut or I just missed it? I thought it would be in the room of requirement but alas, 'twas only Deek and that would ruin my immersion.\n\nThe lack of quidditch didn't really phase me too much, because again, I don't care about Harry Potter.  Besides, the story and various side quests give you enough of an opportunity to become the best student at just about everything else so adding another thing to the list of activities the playable character naturally excels at would probably be overkill. I mean, you already get to beat Professor Ronen at Summoner's Court so there's not really a higher peak in that regard. The guy is practically a god, and I wholeheartedly believe that he let me win that game just to boost my pride. Obviously I am not saying that Ronen is truly some omnipotent being, I just mean he is fucking cracked at grabbing balls from across a big plank while in competition with children.\n\nThe story reminded me of the Mark Twain novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which for the uneducated is a fantastic read, and the subject of a wonderful 1949 film starring Bing Crosby. Now I'm not saying that the writers of this game copied from this book in any way, but their decision to make Merlin the primary villain of the game is a tad suspicious and should really be investigated as to where they came up with that idea. My word is Merlin a colossal waste of space. I hope he is not resting in peace but instead burning in hell like the evil piece of shit he is. I cannot stress this enough, NINETY FIVE UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES. It really puts Ranrok's crimes into perspective, I mean, what did the guy even do? Want a little bit more power so he could presumably enslave humanity? Big deal, were the machines truly the enemy in The Matrix Resurrections or was it the mere existence of the movie? At least I could skip that by never watching it, which isn't an option when it comes to Merlin's moon-sized fucking ego. I cannot believe when seeing the first Merlin trial completion I thought \"huh, that was pretty cool\" because after Merlin trial number 72 I was ready to shoot the cunt like he shot Hank Martin in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.\n\nThat prick aside, the characters in this game are very well written as well as the interactions the playable character has with each of them. It is a shame that at times you are forced into more linear storytelling as early on you can keep your experience with Fig a secret. Later in the game the character just blurts out to everyone that will listen that they can see and use ancient magic which completely negates the option of hiding this information from people in the first place. What if I don't want to trust everyone in Hogwarts?\n\nNow onto one of the best aspects of this game, and no I am not referring to Professor Garlick, but of course the music beautifully composed by Chuck E. Myers, Peter Murray and J Scott Rakozy. You don't really need to know that they were influenced by the work of John Williams, because of course they were, he's the best. Just kidding, of course I'm talking about Professor Garlick. It really is a shame that this game isn't more like Bully with you regularly attending classes to improve your grades, but instead you attend probably under 10 classes in total with a handful of additional assignments. I think it would add to the enjoyment of the game to feature more time in the classroom but primarily because it would mean attending more Herbology classes and as a result getting more time with Professor Garlick. I don't think I really need to go into detail as to why getting to spend more time in that classroom would be a bonus. If the sequel to this game isn't the story of you playing the replacement for Professor Fig, and you get to spend the entire game attempting to seduce Professor Garlick, I will be severely disappointed. There are already far too many stories in the Wizarding World focusing on kids.\n\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, almost as much as I enjoyed writing this review and would have to place it firmly in my top 7 games on Steam.

Potter universe might want from a game set in that world. \n\nThere are some technical issues but none (in my experience) game breaking or disrupting and these are the kind that usually get iron out within a few months of launch. Additionally I don't know anything about whatever controversy people are riled up about but frankly with the amount of scandals in the gaming industry these days I'm just too tired to care and I'm not gonna let people being people get in the way of me having a good time in the fantasy world I like.\n\nSo about the actual game. Hogwarts castle and surrounding areas are rendered beautifully. It's a nearly transition free open world on foot or broom or beast and engaging with the game feels smooth at all times. There's a good number of Red Dead Redemption style open world set-pieces to make it all come alive and you can visit most of your favourite spots from the books/movies in one way or another. Combat isn't too challenging but it does have a good amount of variety which is a sweet spot for me. Professors giving you game tutorials feels a little weird and I wish that was laid out in text and masked more but it is very helpful to figure how everything works. The story is... Fine, a bit of a mish mash of things that were good in the book stories to capitalize on that IP but really the game is about the world you get to explore and it truly excels in that regards.\n\nNow add a Quidditch DLC (Yeah you can't play quidditch in this game), fix the technical hitches and you have yourself a 10/10 title", "timestamp_created": 1677613861, "timestamp_updated": 1677613861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133819791": {"recommendationid": "133819791", "author": {"steamid": "76561199015141616", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 661, "playtime_at_review": 1665, "last_played": 1677682139}, "language": "english", "review": "wizarding", "timestamp_created": 1677613833, "timestamp_updated": 1677613833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133819743": {"recommendationid": "133819743", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121072565", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2325, "playtime_at_review": 3206, "last_played": 1677627734}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful game.

Sometimes I found I could not pull away\n- Ample side activities to fill in your free time as you explore\n- Attention to detail is astonishing. Everything we saw in the movies is there. Moving pictures, statues, ghosts, you name it.\n- Random things sometimes happen as you explore, even if they become old after seeing it more than five times.\n- We can pet chain-smoker cats!\n- You can keep pets (beasts) and brush them, feed them.\n- Gear customization caters to the player's personal preference and does not force you to look like a clown that just left the circus as you wear the strongest gear you could find. You can choose the look of any outfit you found so far on any gear.\n- Large open world to explore\n- Combat isn't like Dark Souls. Controls are easy to learn, combat isn't overdone, which serves to make you feel powerful.\n- Some side-quests are actually quite enjoyable and captivating\n\n-------------------------\n\n[u]Now the bad things:[/u]\n- The developers say that you can choose to be a good or evil wizard. Thing is, with no morality system in place, this is simply a lie. NPCs couldn't care less about you blasting combat spells around them, or picking the lock to their house, steal the stuff of a family sitting by the table, or whichever choice you make at the end. None of these matter. Not even the options you pick in dialogues. The story is as it is.\n\n- The attention to detail is indeed astonishing but it is clear they focused too much on this and not on other aspects of gameplay, like allowing our character to live in the world they are put in. You cannot even sit down in a chair, sleep in your bed, eat with the other students in the Great Hall, no curfew. No interaction at all. You simply exist in the game but don't live.\n\n- There are a lot of side activities indeed and the map is full of them. But there are the same 6 or so types you can do like 50 times. Good luck completing them.\n\n- Ending is a let down. Without spoilers... It doesnt matter what you do, what you choose, what you say... Nothing matters. The ending is meh. Not at all fulfilling. No consequence, no difference. It almost seems like it is incomplete.\n\n-------------------------\n\nAll in all, I did enjoy playing it. But the lack of morality system, the lack of consequences or changes to the plot or flavor of the game depending on your choices was ruining it. Still, I give it a thumbs up because it gave me a good time.

Very mediocre and good at being mediocre. Wait for a sale. \n\nA solid 6/10. Does many thinks okay, a few well but nothing stands out that makes me want to come back to the game, or even finish it. \n\nThe world building is great, I genuinely felt like I was at Hogwarts and everything worked well together, this is because the graphics and sound and music in the game are spectacular. \n\nThe game works with linux and the steam deck right out of the box. Which honestly is wothy of a point all by itself. \n\nThe story is okay at best, how am I supposed to believe I am the protagonist when I'm going around killing mass droves of goblins and \"dark wizards\" as a 5th year Hogwarts student? It doesn't make any sense. It's explained away with mediocre story telling and plot.  The game itself is not that enjoyable. You're a Hogwarts student who barely spends any time in class and the teachers are somehow okay with that. The plot elements are long, drawn out and there's just not enough to keep me interested or entertained. It's just OKAY at best.  There's a lot of elements in the game that mark lazy or bad story telling. Like having a room in the castle thaty you can keep beasts in so they mate together and you can sell their offspring for mad profits so you can better equip you're character to go murdering scores of goblins. It's all not believable. I found myself saying \"REALLY?!\" more than anything else. \n\nThe combat is okay at best too. There's really only 4 enemy types, wolves, spiders, humanoids, trolls. They all share very general attack animations and attack types, and the goblins and dark wizards are really just a re-skin. There's not enough complexity to keep anyone interesting, the camera angles make combat more frustrating than it should be. \n\nThe sounds and graphics in the game are great, it helped with the immersion into the game and I enjoyed it. \n\nThe puzzles in the game are more annoying than they are interesting and lack any sort of cleverness or way to keep you interested in solving it. \n\nI sit back and my time with this game I had more negative things to say about this game than good. I'll probably finish it (at some point) but I grew disinterested rather quickly and there's not enough in the game to really make me want to come back and finish it. \n \n", "timestamp_created": 1677698257, "timestamp_updated": 1677698257, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133875130": {"recommendationid": "133875130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030820049", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 104, "playtime_at_review": 95, "last_played": 1677698870}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely for me a No-No buy.\n\nIt keeps crashing all the time just after I step into the Character's Customization. \n\nI did verified the files, uninstall and reinstall the game, went into the game settings but there is noway I can get this game going, even though I have equipped my system with these components: 1) AMD Ryzen 5 5600G; 2) ASUS PRIME B550M-A WIFI II; and 3 as a Graphic card: NVIDIA Gforce RTX 3060.\n\nAnyways I even asked Steam for a refund and they didn't even bothered to reply to my request.

I'm using a 1660Ti, 32GB ram, and without \"performance mods / fixes\", the game crashes every 10-15 minutes (ie: you have to install Ascendio from nexus mods, modify the Engine.ini & CChromaEditorLibrary64.dll, turn on GPU \"Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling\", & change some Nvidia Global Settings). After the above performance fixes, the game (mostly) stops crashing, but I have to run it on 720p, with AMD 2 Upscale, Good Preset, (RTX off obviously). Anything higher, and the game crashes every 10-15 minutes again. Every time the game updates, I have to reinstall the performance mods. Denuvo DRM continually runs in the background, in short it scans your system looking for any tampering in the game files. Empress (a cracker) who recently removed Denuvo DRM completely, showed the game jumped another 20-30fps. For those of you running the game at 120+ fps, this is negligible, But I barely run the game on 20fps. It constantly stutters during cutscenes, and when loading new scenes. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I've really enjoyed the game post-fixes, the world is beautiful, and feels far more expansive than the movies, and for any Harry Potter fan -- it's nothing short of a childhood dream come true. But I would not recommend the game right now, or at full price. There's many other issues like the female models all use a copy-pasted Male animation rigs & weights, causing unexpected results, like the female models grimacing, making malicious, witch like faces in-game (Google it), and running around like a hooligan with no grace or femininity at all. There's no White / Pale Caucasian or Black skin tones, it starts from tan & ends at a dark brown. All these bugs are listed on the Hogwarts DB and will potentially be worked on in future, but modders seem to be addressing them way faster than developers are. I'd say give it 6-12 months and wait for a sale, hopefully WB removes Denuvo, and the game is in a much optimised state after updates & fixes. Otherwise, we're going to have to rely on the modding community to better the game. I will amend this review once the game is in a better place and I only discourage it in it's current state, and on lower end systems.  \n\nP.s If you have a higher end system, have FOMO / fear of missing out, and want to talk about it with friends, by all means get it.", "timestamp_created": 1677681694, "timestamp_updated": 1677684160, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539978086948394775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133861306": {"recommendationid": "133861306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120095278", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2742, "playtime_at_review": 3869, "last_played": 1677602817}, "language": "english", "review": "Well.... After finishing the game, I'm disappointed. I've waited for it to shine but the more I followed the plot, the worse it got.\n\nThe plot is a huge pile of cliches. Hey, devs, can we stop making overly epic games about chosen ones in 2023 please? Once again, you're special, there's some ancient secret, you need to face trails to open some ancient vault and there those who want to take this power and use it for evil purposes. Serioulsly, so lame. Seen it dozens of times. Villains lack screen time dramatically. You barely see them throughout the game after the first quest and until the very end of the game. Your fellow students and teachers are no better tbh. Side quests are mostly garbage that you won't ever remember. Only Sebastian's questline somehow stands out. But it could have been better too. Oh and yes, it's all linear. There will be almost no choices and exactly zero consequences.\n\nOverall I have a strong feeling that devs tried to shove every single activity from HP franchise into the game. And they failed to make any of it deep and entertaining. The game tries to be everything and remind you about all the movies. But it's just reminders.\n\nIf they wanted a game about Hogwarts similar to early HP books/movies, they should have focused on studies in school, building relationship with friends, some school rivalry like with Malfoy, cosy time in common rooms, sneaking around the castle at night, quiddich, house cup etc. And the plot needed to be more down-to-earth. And currently with all this open world stuff it all feels odd. Nobody cares if you attend classes, nobody cares if you're in your bedroom at night (or slaying goblins miles away from the castle). You can spend all time out of Hogwarts for almost entire game and it doesn't really matter. The game doesn't have the vibe from early books/movies.\n\nIf they wanted a wizarding world adventure game with cool magic fights and open world, they should have made an adult protagonist and probably even remove Hogwarts. Currently a 5th year student that just started his magic education and can already kill 10 dark wizards in battle feels out-of-place. Overall too much fighting is weird for a game about Hogwarts student.\n\nNow to good things:\n\nHogwarts is visually amazing. You can literally spend hours exploring it in search for locations from the movies. And you'll recognize them right away when you find them. It's very nostalgic.\n\nBattles are alright and even fun. Even at the end I stopped sometimes to clear a camp of wizards/goblins. Unfortunately, there are not so many enemy types. Diffiiculty is also a bit lacking. I played on hard and hardly ever needed buff potions or things like Mandragora.\n\nRoom of requirements and magic creatures are pretty cool. The only problem that it's not needed unless you just want to do a bit of farming activities. You need collectibles from these creatures to upgrade your equipment but it's just for numbers, so it's pretty boring. And you'll do just fine without upgrades.\n\nSo it's a big piece of fanservice for HP fans. I'm a fan too, so I liked many of it.

I personally have only ever briefly read the books as a child, and have never watched a Harry Potter movie. I can say for certain that this was a very mediocre game, if it wasn't for the fact that it was in the Harry Potter world it would have bombed with negative reviews.\n\nMy plan was to 100% complete this game to give a proper review, however I simply couldn't bring myself to complete repetitive Merlin trials, bandit camps, loot rooms-All copy and pasted mind you, nearly every single one of them. Most of the side-quests lacked world building, excitement, or even entertainment for that. The 3 main side-quests tied to achievements however I enjoyed very much, such as Sebastion's quest line, Poppy's quest line, and Natsai's quest line.\n\nThe story for me was a 7/10 it wasn't bad, but I simply wish I had more control over what happened in the world. The feeling of choice was extremely lacking in this world, and the fact that I could use certain spells and not have consequences tied to them. The voice acting on the part of the main character you control is god awful, I couldn't tell if it was a real person or AI-Generated, simply boring voice work.\n\nThe developers put 90% of their effort into building the world/environment, and 10 percent on everything else combined. The graphics in my opinion are also lack-luster. Looking at other games released before its time, it's optimization and graphics in general felt 2015 era. Not in all cases however, the world and game is beautiful regardless of that.\n\nThe combat on the other-hand is okay, however the fact that trolls and bigger enemies, can TELEPORT to you across the arena to hit you in an instant without you being able to react to it is INSANE. IM A WIZARD... SO HOW CAN A BIG MOB TELEPORT TO ME WHEN I TELEPORT DASH AWAY?\n\nApologies if this review is all over the place, I may change my review in time depending how this game's DLC and future look. But for now it will stay negative. People need to stop allowing game developers to half-ass games, especially on a franchise as big and beloved as Harry Potter. \n\nTL;DR \nLack-Luster game design, gameplay, copy and pasted quests/locations/characters, Lazy voice acting and build design.

The things in the world (Puzzles, caves, bandit camps, etc.) feel really empty, like a heavily watered down Skyrim, the things you interact with feel mundane and repetitive.\n\n-The Combat is mildly interesting. It's like an EZ mode Elden ring, it does get a little repetitive and I don't think any of the fights were really all that challenging or rewarding to be victorious.\n\n-The Talents skill tree in general feels lackluster at best with some of the options being things that should be included in base kit; the talents in general don't really feel that impactful to the game. The potions and herbology mechanics feel hollow in this same way.\n\n- The Rewards are probably my biggest gripe, you could spend hours being a completionist getting all the various side quests, collections, explorations done and your rewards will generally be a mediocre cosmetic (Here's a Cool Shelf) for your room of requirements. Sometimes the only reward is a steam achievement but almost none of it will be anything that impacts your game play.\n\n- The Story is fun. It reads like a book, (A Very Campy Book) your decisions don't really have all that many consequences and the dialog options don't really impact very much aside from a few lines and maybe your ability to learn the dark arts. The game makes you feel like you're about to make an impactful decision but in the end the result is almost always the same.\n\n- The Gameplay took me about 30 hours to get through the main quest and about 20 more to go through all of the side quests. I don't understand how anyone could claim this has more than 100 hours of gameplay even if you did all of the empty meaningless collections there's no way it's more than 80. I dont Think I'll ever pick this game up again after having finished it,\n\n- In Review they got me to buy it through my love of harry potter and if you're buying it for that reason I would recommend it. If you're buying it because you want to play a great open world RPG I would recommend waiting for the price to come down as it doesn't hold a candle to several open world games.", "timestamp_created": 1677649317, "timestamp_updated": 1677649317, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473749488592147827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133841800": {"recommendationid": "133841800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071386585", "num_games_owned": 186, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 750, "playtime_at_review": 1298, "last_played": 1677057279}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate to see that during 1800 ish in British there r black wizard everywhere.", "timestamp_created": 1677645478, "timestamp_updated": 1677645478, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.393239766359329224", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133840243": {"recommendationid": "133840243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259100517", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2126, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1504, "playtime_at_review": 2126, "last_played": 1677642590}, "language": "english", "review": "Was good until my game started randomly looking and running terrible after about 40 hrs.

Exploring Hogwarts is wondrous and flying around with your broom is the bees knees. Playing wizard/witch dress-up is also fun.\n\nAnd for the negatives:\n\nThe core game is very, very shallow. Every single \"rpg\"- mechanic in this game is a half baked. 95% of the time you get underleveled gear and the models are dupes so no new transmog. Choices don't matter much at all, the story plays the same whatever you choose to do/say. The story is interesting at certain points but the pacing is sluggish and because of the illusion of choice it doesn't really change at all because of your actions. There is no Quidditch and you can't really score house points. At the end of the game you just get rewarded the generic 100 house points and win the house cup automatically. Bummer.\n\nThe world is quite large but the lack of variety really brings it down (the puzzles, the potions, the spells, offensive items, enemies and the creatures lack variety/purpose).  You don't get any new offensive items like wands so it narrows the reward pool down significantly. This means exploration is worthless 80% of the time. You can cast unforgivable curses without nobody batting an eye. Tried to be the most evil slytherin prick and at the end i was greeted as a hero.\n\nThe game also tries to introduce new systems and mechanics till the half point, but nothing new comes on the table after that.\n\nThis is the \"definite Harry Potter game\", but it's still a mid tier open world game with (very light) rpg mechanics. For the content that is here it would've worked better as a 20 hour semi-open world Potter- game, not as a 100 hour open world exploring snooze fest.\n\nI regret paying full price for the Deluxe Edition.

The design of the castle is stunning!\nHowever that cannot make up for the lack of the rest of the game. The facial expressions are simply wrong most of the time - the world is in great danger, your life is threatend and your avatar is basicly smiling and grining all the time. \nThe fighting system is shit, every fight feels like the one before. The skill bars with only 4 skills each are clearly designed for consoles, for PC they are simply a joke. It feels realy clumsy to fight with these and also you have to swap skills every now and than, as there are only enouth slots to fit the fight skills, but if you have to repair, light, summon items or interact with animals for quests quite often. \nThe map looks like it is overrun by  goblins but hardly anybody is taking notice. The story is also lacking imho.\nTreasures are totally irrelevant, as chests are everywhere and the reward is mostly crap. Tombs, caves, riddles and so on are very generic so you know know most of it within 30 min exploring the map outside of Hogwarts (if you have the basic skills at least) The item system is annoying - you have to run to the traiders very often so sell crap, or destroy it so you have slots free when you find better gear. But you don't know what it is before you pick it up. And the process of removing items is driving off, so I startet skipping chests. \nLast but not least the crafting system is mostly irrelevant. Apart from potions you don't need anything apart from quest. You get it all in an infinit amount when you use seeds. Hardly any ingredients need to be farmed. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1677620639, "timestamp_updated": 1677620639, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133823105": {"recommendationid": "133823105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052399449", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1127, "playtime_at_review": 3458, "last_played": 1677617027}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a wonderful experience, very fun to play and has a fantastic progression model, you get things slow, so you have time to play/learn how to use them.

Combat is engaging and the story develops in a very fun way (the parts I got to, at least).

Ya cada cual que valore sus opiniones propias y act\u00fae en consecuencia. \nDicho esto, el juego. Yo no soy muy fan de Harry Potter. Y deber\u00eda, soy del tonto que siempre se pilla el mago en todas partes y el \u00fanico alelao que todav\u00eda juega mago arcano en el WoW. Pero por alguna raz\u00f3n, la trama, seguramente, Harry Potter no me llama mucho, as\u00ed que iba a dejar pasar este juego pero, por cosas del destino, he acabado jugando. Y menos mal. \nEs un juegazo, pero de largo. Y la historia, a\u00fan sin ser tampoco un Last of Us o un Final Fantasy VII, es buena. En mi opni\u00f3n, hasta mejor que la de los libros y pelis de la saga hom\u00f3nima. Quiero decir, peque\u00f1o spoiler, hay una misi\u00f3n en la que destapas una trama de lucha ilegal de dragones. Aqu\u00ed llevamos al cl\u00e1sico personaje de RPG gen\u00e9rico ni\u00f1o, ni\u00f1a o ni\u00f1e (ch\u00fapate esa, Rowlings) que ni sabe ni entiende de que va la fiesta, pero por aquello de ser el elegid@ puede contra un ej\u00e9rcito de magos oscuros, se come a los trolls de dos en dos y se hace a un drag\u00f3n antes del desayuno, mientras sigue de forma rigurosa su carrera acad\u00e9mica en Hogwarts y cuida sus pok\u00e9mon. \nLa jugabilidad, ya sea volando en escoba, en grifo, peg\u00e1ndose con magos, duendes o intentando salvar el pellejo contra infestaciones de ara\u00f1as gigantes (y cuando ara\u00f1as, digo ara\u00f1as, y cuando digo gigantes, digo gigantes, ojo si como yo padeces de aracnof\u00f3bia, lo vas a pasar mal) o practicando magia en las clases, es la leche. El combate a varita va mucho m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de \"\u00a1Flipendo!\" de aquellos juegos de Harry Potter de la plei y tiene combos, parry y al menos dos docenas de hechizos que usar para hacer de todo a tus rivales, desde hacerlos volar, machacarles la cabeza, prenderlos en llamas, torturarlos, dejarlos secos con el rayo de la muerte o convertirlos en un jarr\u00f3n (literalmente). El nivel de personalizaci\u00f3n del personaje est\u00e1 bastante bien, sobre todo con las ropitas, hay cien mil abrigos, togas, m\u00e1scaras, sobreros y pantalones o faldas que puedes vestir en varias combinaciones muy vistosas y majas. \nLos gr\u00e1ficos son \u00f3ptimos, y el nivel de detalle del mundo es enfermizo, un deleite para los fans de la saga, sin duda. El housing es magn\u00edfico (si, tiene housing) y si acaso, falla algo en los di\u00e1logos, donde apenas hay opciones reales.

Le fait d'arriver en 5\u00e8me ann\u00e9e est dommage, en fait si vous vous attendez \u00e0 suivre des cours, vivre comme un \u00e9tudiant \u00e0 Poudlard : c'est rat\u00e9. Les cours sont \u00e0 peine vus, on fait tout pour vous faciliter la t\u00e2che pour que les sorts soient appris vite.\n\n- Les combats sont toujours les m\u00eames, pas d'originalit\u00e9 ou de style vraiment particulier \u00e0 adopter : vous lancerez des sorts principalement. Pourtant l'univers de HP offre un potentiel fou en terme de gameplay. Mais si vous souhaitez jouer m\u00e9tamorphose, potions, invocations... c'est rat\u00e9. Les monstres \u00e0 attaquer sont peu nombreux et n'ont aucune particularit\u00e9 distinctive (que ce soit araign\u00e9es ou serpencendres, le combat sera presque le m\u00eame), \n\n- Les objectifs secondaires sont toujours pareils : les \u00e9preuves de Merlin sont ennuyeuses, les qu\u00eates secondaires aussi... j'ai eu plus de fun en me baladant dans le ch\u00e2teau \u00e0 la recherche de petits d\u00e9tails cach\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer.\n\n- On a la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre bon ou mauvais, mais \u00e0 vrai dire \u00e7a ne change rien \u00e0 la finalit\u00e9 du jeu. \n\n- Les habits et accessoires \u00e0 porter pour avoir plus de stats sont juste AFFREUX ! Voir mon personnage et ses grosses lunettes \u00e0 \u0153il de serpent/dragon pendant une cin\u00e9matique relativement triste m'a compl\u00e8tement sorti du jeu, c'est un d\u00e9tail mais c'est dommage.\n\n- Aucun rappel de l'univers de HP : \u00e0 part les endroits embl\u00e9matiques, on ne nous parle jamais des personnages cl\u00e9s de l'histoire d'HP. Ici le grand m\u00e9chant est un gobelin, ce qui \u00e0 mes yeux est ridicule contrairement \u00e0 la r\u00e9ussite du personnage de Voldemort, les profs sont peu importants...\n\nEn fait tout est relativement insipide d'apr\u00e8s moi. M\u00eame les dragons ne me hypaient pas plus que \u00e7a car on ne les voit que dans les cin\u00e9matiques, tout comme l'\u00e9levage d'animaux qui est pour moi plus une corv\u00e9e que quelque chose d'amusant. C'est peu vari\u00e9 et dynamique ; c'est dommage, car vraiment le jeu n'est pas si loin d'un bon jeu, surtout graphiquement parlant !", "timestamp_created": 1677690666, "timestamp_updated": 1677690666, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133869569": {"recommendationid": "133869569", "author": {"steamid": "76561198809084558", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 905, "playtime_at_review": 2280, "last_played": 1677690606}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u041e \u043a\u0430\u0439\u0444\u0443 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0436\u0438)", "timestamp_created": 1677690637, "timestamp_updated": 1677690637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133869531": {"recommendationid": "133869531", "author": {"steamid": "76561199154044671", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2525, "playtime_at_review": 2525, "last_played": 1677690564}, "language": "polish", "review": "no fajne XDDD", "timestamp_created": 1677690592, "timestamp_updated": 1677690592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133869444": {"recommendationid": "133869444", "author": {"steamid": "76561199070350692", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 448, "playtime_at_review": 1819, "last_played": 1677527152}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\u015feytan tuza\u011f\u0131, \u015feytan tuza\u011f\u0131\n\u00f6l\u00fcmc\u00fcl e\u011flence.\nama ka\u00e7ar,\ng\u00fcne\u015fi g\u00f6r\u00fcnce.", "timestamp_created": 1677690493, "timestamp_updated": 1677690493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133869299": {"recommendationid": "133869299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030984451", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1359, "playtime_at_review": 2864, "last_played": 1677690006}, "language": "english", "review": "Take your time with the game, don't rush it, once it's over you will be sad.

It's not a 10/10 game. It's not perfect. But! It is a fun game, and a lot of heart was poured into it.\n\nJust from spending the first 15 minutes in the game (assuming you're not still desperately trying to customize your character to the best of your abilities), you can probably tell whoever worked on this game is at the very least nostalgic, or appreciative of JK Rowling's 20-year old franchise. You could definitely say that based on the recent chain of abysmal what-should-have-been-direct-to-trash-dvds, there's at least someone who somewhat understands what made the Wizarding World great - it's attention to confusingly stupid but overall interesting lore.\n\nThere are weird creatures, spells that are way too devastating to teach to teens, and insane, childish factions and faction leaders that hold too much power and very little brain capacities, which is exactly where all the fun lies. You'll encounter so many OSHA violations within Hogwarts and its surrounding to make a lawyer's day a good one, and it's where this insane silliness and pure chaotic potential that meet and make this a fun world to explore. The attention to details from the needlessly many media projects is there, and it's glorious.\n\nBut aside from the fan-service, references, and funny details, what does this game give us?\n\nWell, for starters, there's a peculiar spell system that allows you to make your wizard (or witch) spew devastating combos that would fling your enemies around and make short work of any dark wizard or evil monster that would dare cross their paths with you.\nThere're also lackluster RPG elements, where instead of being able to build your character towards a certain offensive, stealthy, or utility builds, your character, for the most part, will end up looking the same after 40 levels, although I would assume most players would stop playing after reaching level 37 or so. I applaud the attempt, but the time I spent rescuing a beast I did not need to rescue, or delving down a dungeon that didn't really feel interesting enough to warrant the effort to go down it... all that could have been redirected towards a better RPG experience within the world that was so lovingly crafted. It's a bit of a waste if you ask me.\n\nYes, dear reader, after about 40 hours this game suffers from what most Ubisoft games suffer as well - a large map that offers too much of the same thing. If the devs scaled back on the pointless collectible stuff, we probably could have gotten better character interactions and more in-depth character builds.\n\nOh! The story! What could I say about it? I remember only one story line, the one that actually has something interesting happen in it, and you know what? It's not even the main one. I feel like if the writers spent more time generating fanfics for houses other than Slytherin, we could have gotten more interesting plot points. Without spoiling anything - the stories are meh at best, aside from that Slytherin side plot, which is somewhat predictable, but shocking nonetheless.\n\nWell. There's that. I could go more into details about the Room of Requirement, but I don't feel like it was really that necessary - it added an odd farmville minigame on top of what is otherwise a decent open world action game. That include the pet rescuing and item upgrade/improvement system which was... okay? You could honestly finish the game without worrying too much about materials, support items, or your petting zoo.\n\nAlright. That's it, right?\n\nWhoops, almost forgot that this game lines JK's pockets, so there's THAT elephant in the room. So, I guess I have to address it, right?\n\nWell, I happen to be Jewish. Have been for a good 30+ years, and I don't plan on stopping now. From what I experienced I saw no antisemetic propaganda of any kind. Sorry chaverim sheli, but I just can't seem to what the fuss was all about, at least in that regard. Of course, if you dislike Rowling and don't want to line her pockets, that's your choice! I fully support you on that decision, and more power to you - but that specific notion is unrelated to how much fun I had with the game, and, for the most part, I had more good time than I had a bad time.\n\nFinal Score: 7.5/10 - It COULD have been better, but I'm satisfied with what I've got.", "timestamp_created": 1677689547, "timestamp_updated": 1677689547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133868631": {"recommendationid": "133868631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051565751", "num_games_owned": 491, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5113, "playtime_at_review": 8187, "last_played": 1677436708}, "language": "latam", "review": " [b]Ah, s\u00ed... el revelio simulator. [/b] Las primeras horas son muy entretenidas mientras te manten\u00e9s en los terrenos del castillo y de Hogsmeade, est\u00e1 lleno de detalles y ataques de nostalgia. Abr\u00eds el mapa y ves que ten\u00e9s un mont\u00f3n de terreno todav\u00eda por descubrir y te emociona. Pero una vez que sal\u00eds a descubrir el mapa te das cuenta que es todo repetitivo, ning\u00fan misterio ni secreto por descubrir, solamente coleccionables y desaf\u00edos de Merlin que se tornan en una tarea tediosa de hacer si quer\u00e9s platinar el juego.\n\nLa historia principal no tiene nada especial, ten\u00e9s que frenar a Ranrok, el l\u00edder extremista de una rebeli\u00f3n goblin, que quiere aprovechar el poder de la magia antigua (magia que aparentemente es m\u00e1s fuerte/especial que la magia com\u00fan y solamente tu personaje y algunos pocos m\u00e1s pueden usar). No hay nada profundo, ni conflictos morales ah\u00ed. La l\u00ednea de quests secundarias de Sebastian Sallow tiene m\u00e1s profundidad que la quest principal.\n\nTus elecciones no tienen ning\u00fan impacto, salvo en el destino de Sebastian Sallows (creo que es la \u00fanica vez). As\u00ed que el juego podr\u00eda no tener opciones de dialogo y seria exactamente lo mismo en cuanto a la historia. El \u00fanico motivo por el que creo que podr\u00edan haber puesto opciones de dialogo es si quer\u00e9s sonar m\u00e1s bueno o \"malo\".\nPodes usar o no magia oscura/imperdonable, no tiene importancia, no afecta en nada, al final del juego tu personaje va a haber masacrado a m\u00e1s humanos y goblins que cualquier otro mago que haya existido, sin que alguien haga un comentario al respecto.\n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos y la ambientaci\u00f3n son hermosos. Ninguna cr\u00edtica ah\u00ed.\n\nLos puzzles se ven entretenidos, l\u00e1stima que tu propio personaje te spoilea la soluci\u00f3n siempre.

My initial play through was filled with wonder and joy. This is the game Potter fans have been waiting for\u2026\n\nStrengths\nTrue to the spirit of the Potter universe. Graphically, it is beautiful even if there is some optimization work still to be done and the usual initial launch glitches.\n\nThe plot works well within the universe, and establishes a foundation for a franchise that can last many years with huge potential for DLC and follow on releases. It would be great if they followed in Mass Effect/Witcher footsteps and provided for the import of saved characters from one game into the next.\n\nI appreciate the less rigid morality tied to (use of) the unforgiveable curses or at least hope that is the developers\u2019 intent.\n\nI loved the combat system and the dueling challenges for each baddie which essentially teach you how to vanquish all foes. It was challenging both as a new player in a normal run, and as an experienced player in hard mode.\n\nWeaknesses\nCharacter customization is severely limited and oddly bland. I ended up using the same model for each play through, tweaking only hair style and eye color because essentially, that\u2019s all you can do to your selected head model although there are a couple of dozen to choose from. I find this a curious approach given that the Hogwarts Legacy world is beautiful, except for the people in it.\n\nRelationship quests aren\u2019t terribly meaningful and I found them for the most part superficial. Neither the MC nor supporting characters are developed to any real depth. Essentially you\u2019re the chosen one with no backstory, doing the hero\u2019s journey. \n\nIn brief moments along the way, you make one friend from Wakanda, one from PETA, and one who possesses the emotional control of a six year-old. When you find out that\u2019s who they are, you\u2019ve discovered all there is to know about them. There is no more.  I liked Natty best but spent so little time with her.\n\nAlohomora should not be a puzzle after achieving level 3. Even in hard mode, this puzzle isn\u2019t challenging and the repetitiveness of it makes it non-canon and tedious. \n\nIt was disappointing that if I needed equipment upgrade supplies or potion ingredients, there are vendors from which to buy them, but once I was overrun with these items, I couldn\u2019t sell them and make some extra coin. Given that, the expensive cost of buying them and virtual worthlessness of them once you have too many makes no sense. On the other hand, I sold a couple of hundred (thousand?) critters off and got paid the same price regardless of how difficult they were to catch, or how many I had sold previously. \n\nThe part I liked the least was the linearity of acquiring spells. Yes, you can get some spells through side quests as soon as you trip the requirements, but the major spells are all main quest driven, no matter what side of the good/bad arc your character rests. \n\nIf you\u2019re paying attention, the main quest isn\u2019t terribly long \u2013 but you are driven to doing side quests if you want the full spell battery and all the fetch missions if you want max level. Hogwarts Legacy\u2019s experience/leveling system is dependent on these fetch missions, which bulks up the play time, but in the end has an ample portion of grind to it.\n\nAll in all, I loved it, and immediately started my second play through after completing my first. It\u2019s a strong foundation, and here is to hope that WB Games builds on it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1677698894, "timestamp_updated": 1677698894, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133876120": {"recommendationid": "133876120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198233693744", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 240, "playtime_at_review": 462, "last_played": 1677449039}, "language": "english", "review": "Gorgeous, fun, love the classes and spells!

There is so much detail that it makes sense for there to be so many things to find hidden but once you move to the overworld (or 'the highlands' as the game calls it) this becomes far less practical and enjoyable. There are so many \"treasure vaults\" filled with clothing that is completely irrelevant to you 90% of the time and just tons of other things that make it a bit tedious a completionist.

If you get it on sale it\u2019s nearly a must have for the variety and charm alone. \n\nI haven\u2019t finished the story yet, but at first glance it is a bit typical. Main character is somewhat of a male \u201cMary Sue\u201d who starts years after everyone, but also manages to outshine them with ease. It\u2019s ok. Not great not terrible. \n\nThe exploration is fun. Hogwarts is full of charm and the countryside has a lot to do. Puzzles of varying difficulty galore. If you want to use potions (you should as they are strong) you will need to explore. It\u2019s a win win that keeps it all tied together and keeps you invested. The environment is full of charm and references. Very fun to explore.  \n\nCombat is very versatile. You can hang back and let plants, potions, and ranged attacks clear the field or get right in the middle and dance around the enemies dealing rapid damage. You need to decide your playstyle somewhat early though as the skill system is permanent. However, I really like the combat system. Currently a potioneer/gardener build.

There's nothing left for me to do, as such, I feel like it's time for a review.\n\nHogwarts Legacy is an amazing masterpiece, however, even masterpieces are subjective. I think what the game excels most in is the combat, the world-design, graphics and how it's relatively bug-free, it's a complete game, which is seldom seen nowadays if we're being honest. There's also the factor of its success being due to the Harry Potter Series, most people are playing it because they're fans.\n\nFirstly, the combat, it's amazing yet so simple. You cast spells of course but in between you're using basic attacks to build up a combo that replenishes your Ancient Magic abilities. It's like you're dancing but in the form of magic and casting spells. \nThe world itself is undeniably amazing, instead of references from the books or movies, you can literally immerse yourself in Hogwarts Castle and the world around it. You won't just be walking around, you'll be flying around on a broomstick.\nThe graphics looks great, even on low quality, there are optimisation issues in populated areas but that's to be expected.                \nThe side quests mostly follow the same formula as you'd expect, fetch something, kill something, rescue a magical beast. They're decently written but quite shallow, you won't remember any of the characters unless they're a part of the companions quest line that involves other students at Hogwarts. These companion quests follow their own story arc that is specific to one companion and it develops over time like a story. Sebastian's quest line is undeniably the best and has insane moral dilemmas. The others companions have quite tame quest lines which are perfect if you're roleplaying, if not, they're still decent.\nThe Houses are irrelevant, whether you're a Gryffindor or Slytherin, it doesn't matter in the end as the story is linear.\nThe voice acting and animations are done quite well, there's only 1 badly voiced character and it's Mr Moon.\nThe diversity of enemies are quite impressive but they are recycled at the end of the day, just different name and appearance but abilities stay the same. \nYou WILL be casting Revelio non-stop, it's a meme and it's true, it's unfortunate and tedious but at the end of the day, you need to spam it if you want to get through the game.\nThe story is subjective, you'll either like it or you don't, but it does \"pass\" as the main bread and butter of the game is being a wizard/witch where you're casting spells and solving puzzles. Almost every quest will involve one or both of these things and for me personally, it wasn't a problem, but for you...\n\nIf you're not into puzzles, you'll find the game tedious. Especially when the solution is one that you've done half a hundred times.If you're a completionist, you've certainly got a lot of work to do. A lot of back tracking, a lot of wandering around in frustration, a lot of repetition. There are 150 pages you have to look for, each one contains a random snippet of lore. 140 decorations for your beast vivariums, 80 different unique appearance costumes to collect, 67 enemy types, 95 repeatable boring puzzle trials and the list goes on and on. The game is heavily congested with collectibles everywhere you go and it's all justified by lore or a short side quest. As a completionist, it was a total hell for me to go through so if you're likely to get that itch to get everything, good luck!\n\nTo conclude, despite what I've written up there, simply put; if you're a fan of Harry Potter and the Wizarding World, book, movies or other prior older games, then you'd be missing out if you didn't play Hogwarts Legacy. If you're not a fan, you might want to do some more research and decide for yourself if the price is justifiable based on what you've seen. Overall, I'd say this is easily one of my favourite games of recent years, am I biased?

The graphics are insane and really transport you to the wizarding world.

You get to attend classes, learn spells, and explore the wizarding world. It's an open-world adventure that you'll easily get lost in for hours on end. Eterniy even!\n\nOne of the best things about the game is that you can fully customize your character. Like, seriously, you get to choose your house, clothes and even your wand! Even the flying is pretty good!\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Hogwarts Legacy to any Harry Potter fan or anyone looking for a wickedly cool adventure.

An open world Hogwarts experience! Amazing.....\n\nBut WOW... what a dull game. I can't believe with all the source material they had, this is the result. Hugely disappointing. There is so little creativity here. Its not really an open world either. \nThey created a beautiful Hogswarts, and then didn't actually know what to do with it. It feels really rushed. \nSaying that. whilst Hogswarts looks amazing, it actually feels like a museum. It doesn't really have a boarding school atmosphere. No kids, just lots of young adults. It's quiet, has a million display cabinets and nothing is really going on. I don't think the devs actually visited a school for research, they just went to the British Museum. \nI'm a new (insanely dull) student, but I know everything already it seems. I might as well be a teacher. It wouldn't make any difference, and actually would make more sense.  \nThe dialogue is painfully boring. The story is painfully boring. The gameplay is painfully boring. \nCombat is ok. Nothing special. \nPotions and herbology, yawn. \nEndlessly upgrading gear is tedious. \nIf you like running about, collecting pointless stuff. This is the game for you.\nHave no fear if you're anti JK Rowling. All the normal wokery is ticked to offset your delicate sensibilities. \n\nConclusion; A massive wasted opportunity.

I was hooked from the start and played it exclusively for weeks and played through more than once which I rarely do.\n\nI prefer keyboard and mouse usually but this is one that definitely benefits from a controller.\nIf the devs decide to build on the already huge world, this could be a game that i could see people picking back up and dipping in again for a really long time. \nWould love to see co-op, I'd play through again just to do it with friends, if anything else just to fly around and enjoy the scenery. \nGreat game, highly recommend!", "timestamp_created": 1677743633, "timestamp_updated": 1677743633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133903757": {"recommendationid": "133903757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039583432", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3740, "playtime_at_review": 3740, "last_played": 1677740724}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're a Potter fan this game is probably a must buy as it would have always been your dream to explore Hogwarts without running into an NPC who looks like their face had been squished with a Looney Tunes frying pan. Even if you're not it's a solid game to play with tonnes to do, and a massive map to explore. Although admittedly, some collectable objectives are a little boring after a while, there is PLENTY of them though so feel free to sink into that if you're a completionist!\n\nHonestly though its got a really engaging combat system in my opinion, especially with the easy to master spell combos, which add to the satisfaction of depulsing someone off of a cliff for a fitting killing blow. As someone who normally button mashes on Mortal Kombat instead of learning combos, that's saying something. I've had a thoroughly great time with it, the Story was great, not perfect and felt kind of rushed at the end, however the characters are good and are very likeable from my point of view, even when they're stubborn and do stupid things. i wont name names. \n\nPerformance is a bit of on issue on higher settings, with frame drops and stuttering, especially around and inside the castle, at least until you've fully loaded in the area, it gets better after a while but you still get them occasionally to a lesser extent. Still i managed to get solid highs of 110 fps exploring with lows of 70-80 during heavy combat scenes on medium settings 1080p with a OC Kaby lake i5 and 3060, the game still looks beautiful on low settings however!\n\n[spoiler] I would have loved there to be more options for dialogue and greater options for morality and consequences for the story which is very linear, which was a little disappointing for me, it doesnt seem to matter if you choose the good or bad ending. There are essentially no consequences for being a d**k head or using curses either which is also disappointing. In fact you actively get rewarded for using the bad dialogue option and extorting more money out of people... because you get to have more money without consequences. [/spoiler] \n\nStill. It is a great game, well worth AAA price and it will give you many hours of fun if this kind of Singleplayer RPG is your thing...

I'm shocked that such a great game has been developed in this age of the game development industry and am so surprised with how good it is to play. The sounds, music tracks, visual effects, story, mechanics all feel really good and play perfectly into the wizarding world. The pure number of \"WOW\" moments is enormous and feels so good and if you are even a small fan of Harry Potter then you need to experience this game and i highly recommend it.\n\nThe game however isn't without issues, there are quite a few bugs usually UI elements not closing correctly, i had one where my camera was stuck on one of my magical beasts and my character could walk around behind them. For the most part the bugs aren't game breaking, in the 50 hours i played i've had to restart twice because of bugs so not a huge problem. But they are there and i'm sure the devs are working on a fix for the majority of them.\n\nThe combat is another thing, when your fighting 3-4 enemies my god does it feel good. The combat is fluid and spells feel awesome and impactful with such detail that makes you feel like an expert wizard/witch. When there's 5 or more on the other hand it become a shit show of dodging and not having enough time to plan or attack or do anything except dodge, it gets to the point where you're having to dodge roll out of every attack because they are coming at you so fast you don't have time to decide if you can protego it or not and most of the time i end up just \"roll, roll, roll, roll, screw this i'll run away come back sneak attack them all and be done with it\" which puts a huge downer on it.\n\nSneaking is another thing, when you transition between areas or cutscenes it will drop your invisibility pretty much everytime so your going through dungeons/buildings being all sneaky then the enemies will just see you and the game ignores that you was trying to sneak.\n\nThere is also a pretty big issue with the protego/dodge alert icon above your head to not display correctly or sometimes not display at all, i've also had it switch from yellow to red mid attack.\n\nSome attack animations will play before you can dodge/block them which makes it so they start the attack animation i cast protego, it does nothing then they attack and hit me. Which sucks and feels bad especially because 80% of the enemies the block signal and animation line up.\n\nThe final issue i have is the filler, there's a huge number of things that just wastes time (opening some chests, merlin trial animation, crawling through tunnels and under things, swimming, etc, etc, etc.) Out of the 50 hours i've played 8-10 hours of it would of been spent on waiting for animations to complete or me rocking on my chair screaming \"HURRY UP, Get on with it!\"\n\nI'm not one to keep playing a game for the sake of it and i will quit a game in the first 10 minutes if there's something i'm not keen on but Hogwarts Legacy keeps me coming back and each time i put the game down i'm left with thoughts and feelings of the world i just left and can't wait to go back to it.\n\nConclusion If your not into the Wizarding world it's still a good game and if it's on sale i recommend trying it, if you are a fan of Harry Potter or even just enjoyed a movie or 2 then buy it, buy it now!

It plays sort of like RDR2 with similar graphics and gameplay, and a similar depth of character customization. I would classify it in between an RPG and an action-adventure game. If you liked Fable, BOTW, RDR2, TW3, etc. and are a fan of the Harry Potter universe, then it's worth a purchase. It should be noted that the game's depth as an RPG isn't something like what you'd expect from traditional build-centric RPGs like Diablo, et al.\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\nThe graphics are great if you play on ultra, but it's worth noting that below ultra doesn't look great for a 2023 game. The lighting system on ultra is absolutely breathtaking and has similar graphics/vibe to RDR2. Ray-tracing is not worth it in this game, it's a massive FPS hit and there are some technical issues (potential memory leaks) that really kill performance even on great hardware. There is a pretty bad stutter issue primarily during cutscenes which make the game less than playable.\n\n[b] Flying [/b]\nUnfortunately, flying in this game was very poorly implemented. The controls are whack on PC. You will have to fix the controls to something more tolerable, but it still just doesn't feel right. I was able to change the controls to make it \"feel better\", but I still find the key bindings counter-intuitive. It would have been better if they modeled the controls after BOTW, or some established game that already solved this problem. Flying exploration is really nice because you can cast Revelio to reveal points of interest on the minimap and on the screen, but it doesn't give you the sense of awe and curiosity that you get in BOTW. Flying in this game feels more like interactive fast-travel. I never found myself curious or interested in exploring with my broom, and I always considered it a means to an end -- to get to the next map marker.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nGame plays well for an action-RPG/adventure game. The combat is fast paced and entertaining, but you will find yourself converging on only a few key strategies. As an RPG, the game is not very rich and you will not have a ton of options to customize your \"build\". Builds don't really exist in this game. You don't get a weapon (your wand is purely cosmetic) and armor is very one-dimensional; min-maxing isn't really a thing in this game. This is why I would classify the game as more of an adventure game like RDR2. That said, the game is filled with well-designed, entertaining minigames, challenges, and treasure to keep you engaged. Similar to BOTW, you will acquire a handful of physical spells which allow you to interact with the world to solve puzzles, acquire treasure, and collect collectible items. The more physical puzzles you solve, the more challenges you unlock, and these challenge milestones gift you with additional skills and bonus content. It's not nearly as intricate or complex as BOTW's puzzles, and the \"puzzles\" in this game get repetitive and grindy. As such, the exploration in this game isn't as rewarding as in BOTW, but it does add to the overall quality of the game since there's a lot to do. You won't feel \"bored\". While the game has a similar vibe to RDR2, the mob exploration in this game feels less organic than that in RDR2. You stumble upon poacher/bandit/spider camps, but it doesn't feel organic; it's all just the same camp copied everywhere. At least in games like RDR2 or BOTW, the mobs felt organic, unique, and not carbon copied all the time.\n\n[b] Vibe [/b]\nThis is the strongest aspect of the game. It successfully immerses you into the Harry Potter universe, which is why I would highly suggest the game if you were a big fan of the books or movies. The attention to detail on the magical wizarding world is very well done, and you will feel the magic and nostalgia while playing the game. Some of the elements of the story are fairly regurgitated from the original source material, but this is to be expected. The additional tidbits of lore in this game seems very true to the source material to the point where the game itself could be considered as original source material. \n\n[b] Character [/b]\nFrom a cosmetic standpoint, you can customize your character quite a bit. There are probably tens of millions of unique outfit combinations with high variance, and your character's looks are often front-and-center in custscenes and during normal gameplay. I found myself excited to get new cosmetic gear, and constantly trying new outfits to see what vibe I wanted.", "timestamp_created": 1677742202, "timestamp_updated": 1677742688, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133902878": {"recommendationid": "133902878", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393641871", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 882, "playtime_at_review": 1330, "last_played": 1677562216}, "language": "english", "review": "Hopefully there will be an online mode soon", "timestamp_created": 1677741615, "timestamp_updated": 1677741615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133902845": {"recommendationid": "133902845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271417587", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4580, "last_played": 1676539333}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game that allows me to live out my Hufflepuff dreams.

Outside of missions, the world is boring. There is no curfew outside of missions, which is a thing that I expected to be in the open world. Quest givers are  in the same place 24/7 (it can be 3AM and a 2nd year student will still be in the hallways asking for help). Shops are open 24/7, so nobody goes to sleep. The only use for day/night cycle that I saw is that there are some beasts (capturable, not enemies) that spawn at night and you can only use your telescope to look at the stars during nighttime. You can use unforgivable curses, but npcs don't react to that (again outside questlines tackling that), so yeah, the world feels pretty much dead.

At first not knowing was a Harry Potter game. Soon did figure it out but was confused. Since there was actual combat and it looked good. Which was not what I would expect from a Harry potter game. \nWas still on the fence a little debating if wanted to get it. Since you play a 15 yr old and figured the world would reflect off that. Making the story itself more appropriate for children or young teens.  Making the dialogue sequences Feel cringy which it actually doesn't.  I'm extremely impressed with the game's entirety tbh. \nThe controversy around J. K. Rowling did seal the deal for me. After hearing that stuff I was like I'm definitely buying it now. Since I thought was BS, since I think she has a right on her opinion. While I also am inclined to agree with her. \nSo in a way I felt like buying this was showing support towards J. K. Rowling. Even though I don't think she had much to do on its development. \nWill say I still have no interest in getting into Harry Potter but This game is good. Far better than I ever thought. The whole world is so engaging and fascinating.  The soundtrack, the visuals, the Combat, the dialogue, the puzzles everything was done so well. Still some stuff I felt it lacked or didn't care for but in the grand scheme of things it didn't matter. \nSo many games last year I was so excited to play that completely bombed.

Fighting the cabal of dark wizards and goblins that we encountered on our adventures. The characters we meet on the grounds of Hogwarts and beyond are amazing with their simple yet effective backstory. You can choose who you want to be.\n\nBut, as an RPG game, disregarding Harry Potter points, I must say the game is lacking in lots of things. Spells that we can access are very limited, and three of them can't even be used outside a specific area, and one of the spell (Alohomora) are locked behind collection quest. The thing I hate the most from this game is the bad item management. Why can't we put items in our common room instead of being punished for forgetting to sell items to vendors?\n\nThe main story is too short for me. There are no effects on what you do besides some dialogues (a character will call you friend or extortionist based on your choice of returning her diary or not), nothing changes the story's conclusion whether you are a sweet cinnamon roll Hufflepuff or dark artist murdering spell happy Slytherin.\n\nI really recommend every potterhead in existence to go and grab this game.

The world building in particular really stands out; at least as far as the Hogwarts castle and Hogsmeade are concerned. The design of the castle is so well thought out and immersive that exploring the halls feels like you're in the movies. It is amazing how everything feels familiar and connected while still being new and vast. With that said the world outside of Hogwarts although visually stunning quickly begins to feel redundant as there are lots of puzzles and quests that play the same or similar. This makes grinding for 100% incredibly tedious. Even the castle itself starts to get old as you run around spamming \"revelio\" in search of the last few field guide pages you've probably passed by a dozen times already without noticing or having the required spell.\n\nDespite the large and beautifully built world, the characters seem to fall flat. Most of the story and dialogue is told through cut scenes, this wouldn't be so bad if the characters' faces and movements weren't so flat. It often felt like watching two walls talking. To top it off the dialogue options were incredibly limited and seemingly made no difference to how the game or other characters interacted with you. It was often tempting to just skip the dialogue and cut scenes entirely. This is especially true the second time around as the game has little to no replay value.\n\nThe combat system is great and unique, you can manage a lot of different spells and have the option to dodge, block, or even parry enemy attacks based on your own play style. It can be a bit overwhelming at first to more casual players, but it shouldn't take long for most players to get the hang of it. The game isn't super punishing or difficult either even at the harder difficulties so mastering the combat system isn't going to make or break the game. Everyone can have fun as they learn to become or more powerful witch or wizard. \n\nAll-in-all this was a really enjoyable and beautiful game with plenty of content to keep you entertained for hours on end. It's only really missing Quidditch and co-op.", "timestamp_created": 1677734728, "timestamp_updated": 1677734728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133899650": {"recommendationid": "133899650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070304413", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "playtime_at_review": 1449, "last_played": 1676794854}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely beautiful game with an amazing world to explore.

It hangs really bad whenever you move to a different area but God forbid you jump. Despite having a lot of people in random places all over the world the game feels kinda empty. The people aren't actually doing anything, and outside of quests nobody even really acknowledges you. A perfect example that really illustrated to me was a dragon swooping down into a field and snatched a sheep and flew off with it. It was unexpected and neat. Then I noticed 20 feet away were a bunch of farmers in a field and not one of them reacted to that at all. Mindless drones.\n\nThe writing is really awkward too, and it's way worse with some characters rather  than others. Natty is probably the worst, I don't know who wrote her but they did a terrible job. Oftentimes, several times in a row, you will hear the same lines repeated, just written a different way. It seems like the game thinks I'm an idiot and need certain details just pounded into my neanderthal skull. It's patronizing and irritating. The skip button in conversation basically skips when it feels like it too, which makes conversations you don't want to have very irritating.  The game needs more polish for sure.\n\nAs for the story, there are parts where it's fun and times where it's mindless fetch quests and chores for the sake of padding the game time I imagine. The details of the lore are God awfully boring as well. The game devs shoehorned as much diversity into the teaching faculty as they could, then didn't have anything interesting about them beyond that. I was hoping magic would be different the world over and I would be enthralled and riveted with tales of Ugandan, or Japanese magic and how it was different. It's not, it's all exactly the same, which makes me wonder why they need a Japanese teacher when there are plenty of perfectly good Brits right there. Real missed opportunity to be interesting here. \n\nThe combat is fun though, it definitely keeps you on your toes and I'm always playing with spells combinations. I think that's the worst part, is that they took a very fun and interesting combat system with some really good ideas and then built a mediocre game around it. It really feels like this game was designed by committee to be as safe and sterile as possible. No risks, no creative writing, and no fun. \n\nIt's good to keep in mind that this company has made nothing but mobile games for the last 5 years, and it shows. It's not the worst game I've ever played, but I would not recommend anyone buy this at full price. It's got too many technical issues on the PC and it's at war with itself over whether or not it wants to be interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1677730910, "timestamp_updated": 1677730958, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133897601": {"recommendationid": "133897601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043976434", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3416, "playtime_at_review": 3422, "last_played": 1677728426}, "language": "english", "review": "+ sense of amazement at hogwarts\n+ cold and gloomy dangerous world outside\n+ art & effects\n+ combat is impressive & fun\n+ big world packed with secrets\n+ amazing acting & questlines\n+ music\n\n- not enough interactions with other characters: secondary npcs are shallow, they dont have life routine, they dont care if you break into their houses.

was a genuine surprise, in a good way. The developer behind this game out-did themselves and in my opinion this game is close to being an absolute masterpiece. The Hogwarts castle itself is reproduced in an astonishing amount of detail; the details that the developers paid attention to is one of the things that makes exploring the castle worth while. When I started this game, I put in a lot of time just simply exploring the castle, before breaking and exploring the greater region around Hogwarts. I would place this game up there with Morrowind, Skyrim, and Breath of the Wild as to the amount of area that can be explored and the attention to detail as your exploring. \n\nCombat is interesting and is unique. There are multiple combos that can made and interesting ways to apply certain spells in combat. You can effectively \"force push\" enemies from ledges and send them spiraling to their deaths (using the Depulso charm), disarm them and then throw their own weapons back at them (expelliarmus and then ancient throw), and even learn and use the unforgivable curses. My favorite combo is accio (bring the person to me), then expelliarmus (disarm), and then depulso (basically a force push). Forces the enemy to run back to me to pick up their wand or weapon. \n\nCasual gamers will find the combat difficult. More seasoned gamers are going to want to play on \"hard\" mode.\n\nYou do need a decent gaming machine to run this game.

You never really feel like a student at Hogwarts. You only get to attend a handful of classes and only for story reasons. You only get to engage with a handful of students and again... only for story reasons. Meaningful side-quests are sparse and there are no real extracurricular activities that make you engage with the world. If there was ever a place to put minigames, the classes, clubs, and student relationships would've been it (please remove Alohamora minigame).\n\nHogwarts is merely the backdrop to your (fairly easy) quest to greatness that oddly feels very segregated and detached from the world. Honestly, right off-the-bat you feel far more powerful than all of the students, and this doesn't go away the whole game.\n\nAll that being said, it's a solid game that is enjoyable and very beautiful.

You can do everything HP related here: fly brooms, make potions, go to classes, explore the grounds and the forbidden forest, shop at Hogsmeade, death party with ghosts, duel. Then there's so many clothing options that you pick up everywhere and pick up talents/skills which are beautifully illustrated.\n\nThe second best thing about the game is just the magical accents/like the movements for spells and the way the objects twist and turn. The effects are spectacular.\n\nThe third highlight is that the characters/people look so good in the Unreal Engine. It's my favorite rendering of people. The cinematic scenes are so nice.\n\nSome of the fighting/enemies and sets reminds me of God of War (the reboot) while the wild areas remind me of Witcher. That's how tough it can get right from the start battling enemies. It caught me off guard. It doesn't feel like an RPG but really like a good open world.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1677723070, "timestamp_updated": 1677723070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133892999": {"recommendationid": "133892999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163020252", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5461, "playtime_at_review": 7211, "last_played": 1677780979}, "language": "english", "review": "My god, this game is just an all around blast.

Its a polished, creative, GAME.  Lots of stuff to do.  Main quests, side quests, pages to collect, 8 million Merlin Trials, treasure caves, potion brewing, plant growing, combat trials, etc etc etc....  and just the sheer fun of exploration!  The quests have nice little story lines and great voice acting. \n\nThe controls are intuitive and make things fun instead of frustrating.  The combat is wonderfully fun....  Pulling enemies toward you and igniting them with flame.... Wonderful.  OH!  And I could beat wolves out of their fur for hours and not get tired of how their pelts howl when i loot their skins.      \n\nWhen you think it can't get better you learn flight, get mounts and get your own customizable room.  \n\nNow, you know I can't stand divisive narratives being pushed in games.....  This game gets the all clear from me.  There are a minority of NPC characters who are LGBTQ, in the 1800s no less, but it doesn't bother me because the story isn't about forcing someone's identity and sexual lifestyle down your throat and trying to destroy you if you misgender.  Their identity comes about naturally as you encounter them in the story, for example, when one refers to her wife, or where one has a deeper voice than you'd expect.   Its not announced in a pride rally with dongs being flung around children while demonizing Christians or white western men.  What a breath of fresh air to see my fellow human beings from different lifestyles being portrayed as just people instead of mentally fragile activists hellbent on sewing discord.  Thus, the story stays focused on the story, and in no way grooms or marginalizes one segment of the population!  \n\nMostly, the game is GREAT at immersion.

Upgrade each clothing three times, put level 3 enhancements on each, and you can basically beat the game with basic cast alone. Now throwing in ancient magic and unforgivable curses, I can basically put down a goblin rebellion single handed. Unforgivable curses are unforgivable for a reason, if everyone throws AK and Crucio around like candy, there will be no wizarding population left. The most frustrating thing about the game is that whatever choice you make, whether it's your house, your choice of friends or actions, your spell set, it doesn't matter in the end. You can AK everyone in front of teachers, students and bystanders, and it doesn't matter one bit. You can go around picking locks in daylight in front of the owner.

It's a relatively smaller open-world RPG. I really enjoyed it. Beat the game at something like 120 hours. Have 125 invested so far with all the challenges complete, all but three collections complete, and 38/45 Steam achievements. I'm sure I could could 100% it but it would be a bit of a mundane grind for a few hours. The story was good, the graphics were great. It was fun to master combat playing on hard with it being difficult at first but then getting progressively, and then exponentially, easier. There are quite a few puzzles that take some brain power, and its fun to find little hidden additions to the game. Like the student who quizzes you on trivia. Its all stuff you can hear throughout the game world. There's a lot of very intricate and clever detail put into this project. I'm not sure that the decisions you make throughout the story have much of a bearing on the outcome of the game. Probably a few of the bigger choices. The subject matter is probably entertaining for adults as well as younger people. And there's nothing explicit. I had a really good time overall. Of course, I'd be interested in a sequel, a larger magical word/map, and DLC's.", "timestamp_created": 1677714449, "timestamp_updated": 1677714449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133887668": {"recommendationid": "133887668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373012685", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 680, "playtime_at_review": 799, "last_played": 1677776697}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't even have time to get over being just absolutely blown away before something else is happening and my mind is being blown away all over again!

If you care much more for story over exploration, it's still well worth the price. I can't speak for non-fans of the series, but I've seen several friends with no interest appear to be thoroughly enjoying the game.\n\nI came into this game with low expectations. Given the low depth of past Harry Potter games, and recent history of various game devs over-promising and under-delivering I made a point to assume this game would be awful so that I could be pleased no matter what. Out of the gates I was absolutely floored.\nThe scale of the game is enormous. I was expecting the castle, Hogsmeade, probably the forbidden forest, and then maybe a little bit of fluff in between. Imagine my surprise when I opened the map and found that it not only zooms out (several times) but also seems to scroll down forever. The map isn't barren, either, it's fairly well packed with puzzles, easter eggs, camps, etc.\n\n\nThe exploration in this game is, for a Potter fan, the absolute peak of this game. I've genuinely spent hours just walking around Hogwarts with the mini-map disabled, wandering aimlessly specifically to get lost in new places with new secrets. Finding a small reference and going \"hey, I recognise that\" and then being able to mentally place that reference next time I encounter it in a re-read of the books has greatly enhanced the game and the series as a whole for me.\n\n\nThe combat is a neat new idea that I think has managed to feel unique without feeling too gimmicky; however due to so much exploration I tended to out-level and out-gear most content meaning sadly I haven't engaged as fully with the combat as I would have liked. Is it the best combat out there? Definitely not. But I wouldn't call it a negative either.\n\n\nI think the story is fine for the most part. I don't personally follow game stories too deeply, so for me to actively pay attention to this one is probably worth something. The side stories generally feel better quality than the main story, but I thought the main story was still above average. Thankfully the story isn't propped up by references to the original series; there are a couple of namedrops here and there but the story in no way assumes that the player knows the reference nor relies on it.", "timestamp_created": 1677712711, "timestamp_updated": 1677712711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133886628": {"recommendationid": "133886628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022652084", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2224, "playtime_at_review": 4920, "last_played": 1677712668}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1677712699, "timestamp_updated": 1677712699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133886625": {"recommendationid": "133886625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198822028662", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1932, "playtime_at_review": 1616, "last_played": 1677781332}, "language": "english", "review": "Just more and more content to play, and when I think it's done, there's more things introduced into the game. 100% worth the money :)", "timestamp_created": 1677712690, "timestamp_updated": 1677712690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133886617": {"recommendationid": "133886617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089648704", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 704, "playtime_at_review": 622, "last_played": 1677737151}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing", "timestamp_created": 1677712680, "timestamp_updated": 1677712680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133886544": {"recommendationid": "133886544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161990786", "num_games_owned": 633, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 817, "playtime_at_review": 1404, "last_played": 1677729782}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyable game.

It is obvious from the very first moments that the developers, programmers, and artists are very much in love with the HP universe and have done all that they can to put you into it.  The world is quite large and the number of fast travel locations is quite adequate.  That said there are a few fast travel locations that dump you very close to enemy spawns.\nGameplay is nothing spectacular in terms of the mechanics, but it is nothing awful either.  There is room for some strategy in your approach to enemy fights, but you can also make it through by simply spamming attack/dodge until the enemy are dead.  The only exception is infiri which you have to set on fire before you can damage them.  Although be warned if you are using the stealth mechanic you can one shot minor bosses.  Spell selection is nice but I found myself most often falling back on 3 or 4 favorites for most battles.  You can have up to 4 sets of 4 spells that you can switch between on the fly which adds some variety, but it is strictly on you to make use of it.\nThe puzzles in the game are, for the most part, fairly intuitive and can be figured out with a little thought.  The story is good, not spectacular, but quite serviceable.  Most side quests are well done, and a few are multi-part story lines that are fun to see through to the end.  Exploration of the world is fun and you will encounter many locations where you just go 'yes' that is exactly like it should be.\n\nThe good:\nDecent gameplay with a fair amount to do.\nExploring the world is enjoyable and there is enough variety that you want to keep going to see what is over the next hill.\nCombat is challenging but no too difficult.\nYou get to explore Hogwarts, Hogsmead, and the world around them.\nFlying on a broom is a fun way to get around, although Hogsmead is a giant no fly zone (no idea why)\n\nThe bad:\nToo many people are trying to make a political statement out of the game instead of looking at the game as a game.\nMany of the treasure locations take about 1 minute to complete and are total cut and paste jobs.\nA number of collectibles are tied to specific missions and only show up in the world after that mission is completed.\nRevelio helps you find stuff, but you have to spam it to find some items as they are only revealed at very close range.  Fortunately there is a ping sound that lets you know they are around, but it is a spherical search area so the item may be above or below you.\nReplayability is minimal and the only real difference between playthroughs is which house you select; which affects only a very small portion of the game.\n\nAll in all at 70+ hours in I have been having a lot of fun and Hogwarts Legacy is definitely worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1677707098, "timestamp_updated": 1677707098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133882664": {"recommendationid": "133882664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198283108564", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 714, "playtime_at_review": 1850, "last_played": 1677280016}, "language": "english", "review": "I havent watched or read the J.R. books of Harry Potter however i damn love this game it has been amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1677706907, "timestamp_updated": 1677706907, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133882590": {"recommendationid": "133882590", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965538015", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3849, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2330, "playtime_at_review": 3849, "last_played": 1677706613}, "language": "english", "review": "Even if you're not a Harry Potter fan or watcher / reader of the movies or books, this is a brilliant game.

However I feel that a lot of content in this game was either half removed/made and or not optimised.\n\n- Good amount of quests that also played on your morality.\n- Fight scenes were fun, Remove the lock target and you'll improve the fight scenes greatly (I used controller). \n- The puzzles and side quests were engaging and fun.\n- I played my only play through on the hardest difficulty, I have not 100% the game but its already taken about 69 hours.\n\nThe things I feel they need to add into the game or fix:\n\n- Fully bring in the curfew system.... Literally only two missions forced me to sneak around. Using invisibility was almost unused for at least 98.5% of my game play. With this I also feel your house/dorm room really isn't utilised at all. I think i spent less than 30 minutes there the whole game and that was mainly at the beginning. \n- Why is my character the only one wearing a different style of house robe? It would be nice to see other students wear a variety... I did see a single student wear a quidditch outfit, which was very out of place (because its its banned at hogwarts this year).\n- I won't get into a quidditch rant, obviously thats been touched on many times over.\n- Some voice lines get very over used, mainly the Hogsmeed one (we all know what this is). \n- I would also love to see more races/time trial's for the brooms.\n- More duel's would also be awesome!\n- The evil ending didn't seem as flushed out as the good ending, it was very glazed over it seemed (I did both endings).\n- Maybe a year 6 DLC?\n\nOver all, I would be happy to come back to this and see if their has been more updates to the game play, maybe some optimisation. I don't feel like its game of the year but I had a very fun time playing it! I'm Excited to see what the future holds for this game!\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1677706356, "timestamp_updated": 1677706356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133882058": {"recommendationid": "133882058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050022301", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1059, "playtime_at_review": 893, "last_played": 1677780081}, "language": "english", "review": "\u03a5\u0395\u03a3!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1677706128, "timestamp_updated": 1677706128, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133882055": {"recommendationid": "133882055", "author": {"steamid": "76561199038283534", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3183, "playtime_at_review": 3171, "last_played": 1677781259}, "language": "english", "review": "Repair your  bugs ... game is exiting every time with out of memory issue ,,,, so disappointing", "timestamp_created": 1677706125, "timestamp_updated": 1677706125, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133882032": {"recommendationid": "133882032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277042692", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1475, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1475, "playtime_at_review": 1397, "last_played": 1677710531}, "language": "english", "review": "the graphics are super nice, it runs pretty well with decently short load screens, the game play is intuitive, and the attention to detail is absolutely phenomenal. they really studied the books to get absolutely everything in it's place. for sure a recommended game. this'll probably get sooooo many awards.", "timestamp_created": 1677706106, "timestamp_updated": 1677706106, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133881977": {"recommendationid": "133881977", "author": {"steamid": "76561199079024888", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2497, "playtime_at_review": 3557, "last_played": 1677711854}, "language": "english", "review": "fun, good combat and world building", "timestamp_created": 1677706049, "timestamp_updated": 1677706049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133881792": {"recommendationid": "133881792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054088514", "num_games_owned": 601, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2139, "playtime_at_review": 3570, "last_played": 1677766932}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game just wish it had a morality system so everyone could fear me.", "timestamp_created": 1677705834, "timestamp_updated": 1677705834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133881682": {"recommendationid": "133881682", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119488218", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 3039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1998, "playtime_at_review": 2997, "last_played": 1677773139}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.", "timestamp_created": 1677705689, "timestamp_updated": 1677705689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133881669": {"recommendationid": "133881669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085412795", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 273, "playtime_at_review": 1750, "last_played": 1676662658}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely Stunning work from a game studio whose last game was Cars.

The choice of House is mainly cosmetic, but I'm glad its there, and it adds to immersion.

And it's very good, but the best parts of the game were the character quests, the dueling club, and the castle secrets. Imagine if we had gotten even more!

Could do with a lot of improvement though. \nVery 6/10ish. \n\n[Good Stuff]:\n+ : PETTABLE CATS\n+ : Reasonably pretty game, assuming your computer can handle it.\n+ : Open world with plenty to explore.\n+ : Fairly satisfying combat.  Especially once you get Descendo.  Who even needs the killing curse when you have the \"mash face into ground\" spell? \n+ : Fantasy RPG.  I like Fantasy RPGs. \n+ : Probably enthralling if you like Harry Potter... for whatever reason. \n+ : No Quidditch.  Thank f\u016dck for that. \n\n[Bad Stuff]:\n- : Stupidest setting ever.  That is J.K.Rowling's fault though. She sucks at worldbuilding,  so just about everything in the setting is utterly nonsensical even by fantasy standards.  Basically everything has to be magic because it makes things fancier, nevermind if the nonmagical solutions are simpler.  But apparently mundane solutions or logic are for muggles because the entire cast come across as a bunch of upper middle-class tw\u00e4ts who can't do things with their hands because they might lose a cufflink or scuff their precious fingernails.  But I guess if you're a brat who choffs caviar with a silver spoon and want magic to tie your shoelaces because your personal maid had enough of your sh!t, then this is definitely the game for you. \n- : Sh!t plot.  Really.  It is.   You just do a bunch of puzzles and then decide if you want to be stupid, insane or evil. The side quest plots are also similarly stupid. Not even joking.  The \"good\" ending basically involves being Smaug. \n- : The characters are shallow, two-dimensional things... which I guess is normal for toffs. Quest-givers generally only have one thing on their minds, and those uninvolved with any of the quests or plots have nothing on their minds whatsoever.  Background conversations between NPCs are reminiscent of Oblivion in their awkward disconnectedness. \n- : Over 90% of the game content is split between the same few puzzles repeated ad nauseum, and tons upon tons of collectibles.  Even most of the plot quests are the same.  Still, I'd rather be doing puzzles in the countryside than dealing with the NPCs.  And since I have no interest in decorating the room of requirement, NOR in learning any more about the setting, the collectibles are just a nuisance. \n- : Significant frame drops in some places, particularly around Hogwarts itself.  Others also report stuttering and various other graphical issues, though I've had less of those myself. \n\n\n\n...  And yes, I realise the negatives section was bigger than the positives, but I am prone to grumbling.   \nIt was, overall, a positive enough experience that I didn't end up hating it.", "timestamp_created": 1677704731, "timestamp_updated": 1677704817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133880866": {"recommendationid": "133880866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294489270", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1627, "playtime_at_review": 1495, "last_played": 1677712608}, "language": "english", "review": "There is so much to do in this game and it is a blast to play", "timestamp_created": 1677704647, "timestamp_updated": 1677704647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133880788": {"recommendationid": "133880788", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080465332", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 197, "playtime_at_review": 929, "last_played": 1677612764}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game\n", "timestamp_created": 1677704555, "timestamp_updated": 1677704555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133880776": {"recommendationid": "133880776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288225663", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1353, "playtime_at_review": 3526, "last_played": 1677731918}, "language": "english", "review": "lovee iiiitttttttttttttttttttttttttttt, Sadly with older pc and low graphic cards it sucks but over all i love it and to keep on a light note this game is fun with a few twist an turns", "timestamp_created": 1677704542, "timestamp_updated": 1677704542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133880773": {"recommendationid": "133880773", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961088909", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 2019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2019, "playtime_at_review": 1902, "last_played": 1677711569}, "language": "english", "review": "Rich story, combat is fun.

The exploring, the puzzles, the combat, the character \ncustomization's, as well as the brooms and mounts are all awesome. \nI love the environmental details, the moving paintings, statues, armor sets, etc, etc\nThere's a lot to like with this game imo.

Magical feels overused but that's exactly what this game is. There is so, so many magical things and details from which you can see how much love went into this. I've finished the main story now, played almost a 100 hours and I still keep gasping and tearing up at every corner. \n\nThis game made me laugh, cry and everything in between. I'm not a completionist but this game makes me want to complete every single thing just so that I discover all of the astonishing details to the environment and the characters. I'm someone who skips through dialogues in games because it's hardly ever interesting or well written and I haven't skipped a single sentence here. I hate combat that counts on your reflexes because I have anxiety but this game made the difficulty so well balanced I actually enjoy being able to react.\n\nBut my absolute favourite and by far the most unexpected game mechanics is the room of requirement and the ability to decorate so much space. As someone with hundreds of hours in Sims 4 spent mostly building houses, I have to tell you that I cried every time the room expanded and gave me more space. Honestly, it's even a bit overwhelming and I begged it to stop but I guess it knows what's in my heart.\n\nDo I have things I wish the game had? Absolutely. Do I still think it's the best, most intricate and most magical game I've ever played? You bet. The amount of gameplay and the size of the world makes up for any details I would've welcomed but I do hope we'll get some future content because I want to continue living in this world. Though to be honest, I'll continue to do just that even without the content. Still so much space to decorate, so many sunsets and sunrises to see and gasp at and so many cats to pet!\n\nTL;DR: This game made me laugh at all the little details and cry literal tears over some others. 10/10 would cry again.

It seemed like the story had tons of layers. It ended up being only about the main story and like 2 in depth side character quests thus I found the game to actually be superficial.. If you looked any deeper it was like... wow, really? My main gripes is that the currency/store is awful, most items are awful, dungeons were terrible (no really, why bother adding something so lackluster to the game) and even something like collecting all the merlin trials was useless. I at least thought there would be a side quest or a cinematic there but no, they really dropped the ball on this. I also wish that decisions actually mattered like they hinted in the story.\n\nAnyway, I have to hand it to them, the models and animations are fantastic and there were times I was just gawking at a bookcase watching the animations for books. Like thats crazy, someone animated that. The castle was beautiful! I found myself admiring the tapestries or statues because they were beautiful, inspiring even. I loved designing the room of requirement and having so many cute magical beasts. I enjoyed going to the classes at first (later they I feel like they just turn into cheap commercials). The magical aura of hogwarts kept bringing me back! I think I enjoyed the main questline but I just wish there was more depth and content as it was too streamlined.

There is SO MUCH detail put into the castle that your first several hours of exploring it feel like how exploring Hogwarts should feel. You stop and stare and listen so much in this game I really felt like I was there. But as soon as you've done a once over on the entire place you start just feeling like you are running from point A to point B to complete quests. \n\nWhich is honestly expected in most games. Even some of my favorite RPG's like Persona and Cyberpunk loss their luster after several hours. But they both had engaging plots and characters that kept me immersed, because it no longer became about looking at every tree and graffiti on the wall, it became about them, they were the immersion, they were the thing that felt real.\n\nI don't think the story or characters in Hogwarts are bad. I really like Sebastian a lot, its really interesting to be friends with someone from a house was always considered \"An Enemy\" in the other source material. He is a very morally gray character who is driven and not just \"evil\" or \"good\" and that makes him interesting and makes me want to see his quest to the end. However the game frames his story, and the other major story points, as all very black and white, and thats where I lose interest. \n\nThe big villain is BAD and is using magic that is BAD. You're the chosen one and YOU get to save the world! Blah blah blah blah. Been there, done that, a hundred times over in almost every form of media available. And there are great examples of this format done well. Mass Effect, or Avatar the Last Airbender for example. But the cast of characters and their dynamics with one another carry those stories. We want to see how THEY do it. \n\nNone of the characters really seem to know each other outside of your main character being the most important thing to happen to anyone since sliced bread. And again, I like most of these characters indivdually, I like all the professors and there are some real genuine moments. But the way the writers handle the overlapping narrative threads and themes feels beyond sloppy, in fact it feels like there was no real thought given to them at all, and that makes the world feel bleak and empty, like its no longer a world for you to exist in, but a game for you to run around and do stuff in and feel like an overpowered hero. \n\nI still really enjoyed my time with this game, and I got my money's worth. I just did not feel motivated to see any of these stories, main or otherwise, to their conclusion. \n\nOverall I'd give the game a C+, it was good, and in some moments it was great. But that greatness becomes spread WAY to thin towards the end and I felt myself craving more, and needed to move onto other things.

However, I purchased this game after watching others play it and I have to say Its a fun game. The details are visually pleasing, the story itself is decent compared to other recently released titles. \n\nThe character customization is not too complex but there\u2019s enough options to get the character you\u2019ll be happy with. I was actually also quite surprised by the amount of details that went into the hairstyles alone. \n\nThe world itself is reasonably lively but not as overly interactive as I\u2019d hoped given all the details put into the world. However, the interactions you do have in the shops and at Hogwarts still help liven up the world even by a little bit. Inside Hogwarts you have the moving stairs, paintings, statues, and other living oddities within Hogwarts is a treat. there\u2019s a lot going on all the time and it makes exploring the Hogwarts castle all more enjoyable. \n\nOverall this game has been a pleasant experience and Granted I have not finished this game as I wrote this review but from what I have seen so far I think anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter franchise will more than likely love this game. \n\n\u201cHocus Pocus I summoned a Ford Anglia 105E\u201d -Ron Weasley", "timestamp_created": 1677863875, "timestamp_updated":

This means everything is from a kid's perspective and involves a lot of school life experience. There will be many cringey moments that don't make sense if you are already an adult.

Its not \"ground breaking or revolutionary\" but not every game needs to be those things in its genre, respective game play. If your a harry potter fan or like me grew up watching the movies this definitely brings back nostalgia or at least puts you in the atmosphere. \n\nFrom my understanding its 100 years or so before the movies etc so keep that in mind. Either way i feel the developers did a excellent job. There are so many little details spread all across the map, Hogwarts that reflect very well on the lore, books. \n\nMy favorite things about the game are the potion making, crafting and using of these things as a \"Battle Enhancement\" they are not necessary but do give little edge in certain fights, situations. The spells and combat feel fluid and nice with many combinations to deal with your enemies. \n\nThe only thing i found a bit tedious is the spell management. You have many spells for different situations and only 4 rows to alternate between which most of time have to be constantly replaced at least 1 or 2 slots in these rows on occasion. Im not sure how this would be fixed or a different solution.\n\nOverall  there are so many side quests and even main quests etc still do, this game is quite fulfilling in the sense of things to do. I would rate the game a 8. Its solid all around and definitely beat my expectations. With many more hours i know im going to pour into it i know and feel i got my money's worth already.

I recommend this game to everyone 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1677853134, "timestamp_updated": 1677853134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133978475": {"recommendationid": "133978475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144283682", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3348, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3348, "playtime_at_review": 3184, "last_played": 1677867767}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games, and even more fun if you are a fan of the HP world", "timestamp_created": 1677853050, "timestamp_updated": 1677853050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133978435": {"recommendationid": "133978435", "author": {"steamid": "76561199009010570", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5670, "playtime_at_review": 5670, "last_played": 1677677497}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're a Harry Potter fan, this is a no brainer !

tree canopy into the forbidden forest and it just opens up into a darker setting, they really did pull that off good. the story is good although i found it quite annoying that professor fig would repeat what you just said for example your character would say \" i been into the forbidden forest\" and professor fig would say \"youve been into the forbidden forest\". happens time and again throughout the conversations you have with professor fig and it is quite annoying once you pick up on it.\n\nAfter completing the main story and all the side quests and most the collectables i have found myself at a bit of a stale mate as most of the other collectables are quite tedious and the world does become quite empty feeling after youve completed most activities, i wish there were random world events or some form of daily challenges to complete, i wish there were most classes you could attend or more dualing with class mates. its a shame because hogwarts is so cool to roam around in but there really isnt anything to do in there once the content is completed.\n\nI hope they build upon this game with DLC because it is good and i really enjoyed the 40 + hours playing but the replayability just isnt there for me, i was hoping to 100% this game but i ve lost the motive for now.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1677846753, "timestamp_updated": 1677846753, "voted_up": true,

I've since come to reconsider due to a couple of points that I'll point out soon. \n\nFirst and foremost I'll say the game is *definitely* worth getting. The combat is fun and quite intuitive, Hogwarts itself is *huge* and absolutely amazing, there's so much to discover and some nice lore included with a lot of the \"points of interest\" you find. I kept finding places in Hogwarts I hadn't been yet even after *40 hours* of playing. The world itself is also very pretty and it's quite satisfying to fly around on your broom exploring it. The story arc is pretty good, topped off with excellent side-quests following a couple of other students that on occasion ties in with the main story to varying degrees. I never found myself bored with these quests and found them fun and intriguing. The room of requirement serves as a kind of \"player-made housing\" area and is generally really cool in my personal opinion. Could spend hours there.\n\nNow, the reasons I've come to reconsider my initial praise of \"Open World RPG game of the decade\". The game sports some classic elements and tropes of the RPG genre. Levels, talents, gear, potions, fast travel etc and in and of itself, that's not an issue, but I'll go over my critiques for the way they've been implemented in this particular game.\n\nThe leveling and talents of the game are quite fine in and of themselves, however they do provide a player with a *very* large increase of power immediately once unlocked. By retroactively providing you with talent points once you unlock talents around level 15~, you get ~15 talent points immediately that *significantly* empowers spells. This surge of power felt out of place and I think I'd rather they have introduced talents off the bat so we could 'grow' in power with them. \nIt's worth noting that you will not hit a level where you've unlocked all talents. Even by avoiding for example the Dark Arts tree all together you'll end up having to sacrifice not unlocking every other talent. With all of that said, let's move on to the next point. Gear.\n\nThe gear system in this game follows the all too familiar tier-sets including the familiar colour scheme of \"Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary\". This is not inherently a bad thing and is easy to understand for veterans of the genre and newcomers alike. It also sports a type of 'enhancing/perking' system that in and of itself is unlocked way too late into the game, and this ties into my main gripe with this system. The main benefit of higher tiers of gear is it's capability of being upgraded further, and enhanced with stronger perks. Due to how late in the game you actually unlock the ability to upgrade and modify the perks of your gear though, it really ends up just being a game of \"Which piece has the higher stat\" for a very large portion of the game and makes gear tiers early on feel absolutely pointless. Couple this with visual overrides being a thing you can do whenever and wherever, and your gear choices feels even less like a choice. Perks are however incredibly powerful in terms of enhancing your spells/resistances and I think they wanted to rely on this to be where you'd make the choice of perk VS stat. The problem with this is the very vague information provided of how much a perk actually benefits you. It's simply stated that it \"Slightly, Greatly or Significantly\" enhances spell damage or damage reduction against X foe. Which brings the next topic, the combat scaling.\n\nWhilst combat is fun in the game, it is way too easy for any veterans of the genre. Even on the hardest difficulty, it's too easy and I found myself not having need for the potions designed to help you in combat at all. Coupled with it being rather annoying to scroll through and use them in the heat of the moment, you end up simply forgetting they exist in the first place. Early to mid game you'll find yourself practically losing all your health in 1 hit, but you never get defeated from a singular hit. An enemy needs to hit you when you're at \"0\" health for you to actually be defeated. This means that when missing a block or a dodge, if you simply react fast enough and chug a healing potion, you're good to go for another hit. Whilst some enemies do 'chain' attacks they're rather few and far between and usually not an issue. \nImportant note: The game does *not* sport the option to have enemies that would be below your level be scaled up to match yours to retain difficulty, meaning that if you like me enjoy to explore the world and doing side-missions, you find yourself indirectly punished in the rest of your combat/main story combat becoming significantly easier due to over-leveling them. On that, let's get into my main gripe with the game world.\n\nLike mentioned at the start of this post, Hogwarts itself is absolutely amazing, and you can tell they've put a lot of time and effort into building it and all the POI's in it. The same could be said for Hogsmeade, but then there's the rest of the playable world. Don't get me wrong. It looks amazing and there are some rather nice POI's and puzzles around, however you quickly notice once you start properly exploring that it all feels very copy-pasted. The only really unique things on the map is the Hamlets and regions themselves. The dungeons usually sport the exact same layouts with the only variation really being which one of the 4/5 unique puzzles you'll encounter at the end. Top this off with very few of them actually housing enemies and they become very boring very quickly without any real kind of challenge or novelty. This is rather lack-luster for an open world RPG and ended up being quite disappointing for me. Even the ones that do sport enemies usually only have 2-4 of them which is an absolute breeze to deal with. The surface puzzles ends up being very repetitive as well and all in all it ends up feeling a bit empty/shallow. \n\nThe game sports the very weird decision to unlock the arguably best mount of the three options first. This, combined with a very wide-spread fast-travelling system, makes later unlocks therefore feel pointless. You start off by unlocking the broom, which is a rather agile and fast way of flying around. You then unlock a Hippogriff which might be faster than the broom initially, but once you upgrade the broom, it matches and eventually beats the hippogriff in speed *and* agility. Last of all options you unlock a ground-based mount that doesn't really serve much use at all aside from gear materials. \n\nAll in all I did enjoy the game for what it was and have no regrets in buying it. It's a really fun game and whilst it does on many occasions feel like the game's trying to be a jack of all trades at the cost of mastering few/none, I do believe that a lot of these pain points I've brought up are things that could be fixed. The open world *is* lack-luster, the exploration and puzzles does feel repetitive. However the story and quests are really, REALLY good, and combat for what it is is very, VERY fun albeit too easy. \n\nI feel like this game is set up for future DLC's to be added, opening up new areas for us to explore and new quests to do. If they put some more time and effort into actually making dungeons and puzzles more unique in those areas, and add the much needed option to have enemies up-scaled to match your level, some more clarification of what gear stats and perks actually provide, the game could very easily find it's way into my top 3 favourite games of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1677837091, "timestamp_updated": 1677837091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133965493": {"recommendationid": "133965493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048088383", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 866, "playtime_at_review": 831, "last_played": 1677875431}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing and beautiful game.

Developed by Avalanche Software and published by Warner Bros. Games, Hogwarts Legacy has already generated a lot of buzz in the gaming community.\n\nFrom what we know about the game so far, it looks like it's going to be an immersive, open-world adventure that lets players create their own wizard and attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. You'll be able to explore Hogwarts and its surrounding areas, cast spells, brew potions, and encounter magical creatures.\n\nOne of the things that has me most excited about Hogwarts Legacy is the fact that it's set in the 1800s, which means we'll get to see a whole new era of wizarding history. The game promises to have a deep and engaging story, filled with mysteries to uncover and choices to make that will impact the game's world and your character's journey.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that has me excited is the level of customization that will be available. Players will be able to create their own wizard, choose their Hogwarts house, and even select their own wand. This will make each playthrough unique and allow players to truly feel like they're a part of the magical world of Harry Potter.\n\nOverall, I think Hogwarts Legacy has the potential to be an incredible gaming experience that will appeal to both die-hard Harry Potter fans and gamers who are new to the franchise. With its beautiful graphics, immersive gameplay, and captivating story, I have no doubt that Hogwarts Legacy will be a game that players will be talking about for years to come.", "timestamp_created": 1677833445, "timestamp_updated": 1677833445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133963361": {"recommendationid": "133963361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123106061", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1648, "playtime_at_review": 940, "last_played": 1677875774}, "language": "english", "review": "good \n", "timestamp_created": 1677833290, "timestamp_updated": 1677833290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133963310": {"recommendationid": "133963310", "author": {"steamid": "76561199061523151", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 221, "playtime_at_review": 226, "last_played": 1677833185}, "language": "english", "review": "YER A WIZARD HARRY", "timestamp_created": 1677833209, "timestamp_updated": 1677833209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133963213": {"recommendationid": "133963213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018787660", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "playtime_at_review": 452, "last_played": 1677834009}, "language": "english", "review": "i dont much care for harry potter but i like magic in games and to make twitter mad :P", "timestamp_created": 1677833006, "timestamp_updated": 1677833006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133963140": {"recommendationid": "133963140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042164959", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4013, "playtime_at_review": 4380, "last_played": 1677874865}, "language": "english", "review": "so the vibe", "timestamp_created": 1677832857, "timestamp_updated": 1677832857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133963109": {"recommendationid": "133963109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148939060", "num_games_owned": 380, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1228, "playtime_at_review": 2838, "last_played": 1677093879}, "language": "english", "review": "A wet dream for any Harry Potter fan", "timestamp_created": 1677832797, "timestamp_updated": 1677832797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133963089": {"recommendationid": "133963089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062414800", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2621, "playtime_at_review": 3942, "last_played": 1677452147}, "language": "english", "review": "A video game made by and for Harry Potter fans.\nThe game itself can be rated 7 but the fact that is made for Harry Potter fans I would say is an 8.5.\nI could extend more about the pros and cons but I'll make it easier.\nIf you like Harry Potter you should buy it.

It's very simple in its story and reminds me of how games used to be. Not necessarily stale or linear, but enough so that you can easily follow along while still stopping to do side quests or to look for collectibles. The characters are quite memorable, and although Sebastian seems to have more of a spotlight, many of the other characters make up for it in personality. My favourite character is Ominis. \n\nThe graphics are stunning, and even with a now outdated laptop, still runs quite well as the game streams its content in a way I'm not used to. Bugs happen, but that's the norm these days. The developers are working quickly on updates and seem very connected to the community, which is a great privilege considering the controversy surrounding the series. \n\nIf you plan to play this game due to the controversy and wonder if it's worth it, I do recommend this game.

Especially for me, who is in love with the hogwarts universe. Has its downs that should definitely not be looked over but the ups are so damn good, too. Honestly, i definitely 10000000000000% recommend it. Not perfect, but i definitely did not waste my time with it (and as you can see... i played quite a lot rip). I do think that the ending of the game is a bit \"oh... is it over, then?\" but it also leaves an open path for them to bring more content and even make some sort of continuation, as the school doesn't end in the 5th year in the books.

You're force fed a storyline that you cant influence. You're a student trying to stop the forces of evil, yet you walk around killing goblins and dark wizards without a second though of the morality of the situation and have a higher body count than they could ever dream of. \n\nIn the begining they captured the magical feel of the harry potter universe. But it quickly becomes stale when you realize there are basically 5 enemy types and they all act the same with the same spam attacks.\nThe majority of the content is collectibles. Find 10-20-30-50 of these and get.........nothing of any value.\nThe loot is random. Go through a dungeon and the last chest with a worthless item that is worst than any you have. find a chest in a bush outside somewhere randomly and find an amazing high tier item. It makes zero sense. There is no point in finding the treasure chests as their is only garbage in them.\n\nI goit 30 hours out of the game and was interested for about 15 hours of it. The last bit, I got to my second trial and after the 3rd mob and fighting the camera as well as the boss, I uninstalled. This just isnt fun anymore and I have no interest.

I did a near completionist run of this game, gathering almost the entire collection so far and I do intend to go back to finish off the achievements. \nI loved MOST of this game. The visuals and characters are engaging. The world building is not only beautiful but a fascinating mesh of movie and book descriptions. The map of the game is truly awesome and the play-style inside of the world is fun. There were some key-binding errors where binding would respond to default binding despite showing otherwise in the settings, graphical glitches, and a few game anomalies but these were not too horrible to play around. \nThe plot had some issues. I was disapointed that the entire game was exactly what I thought it would be upon the two minute mark of playing. The plot is very predictable and not often nuanced. As a writer, I was disappointed that characters like Isadora never had direct screen time beyond a short memory you view part way through the game. You never discover a key aspect of any video game which is who you are in all of this or why you are joining late, or why you can see this ancient magic that no one for hundreds of years are able to see. This is a crucial hole in the story I find, as it gives your character little purpose beyond \"the chosen one.\" You also never wield the magic in any way like the keepers do beyond fighting and it did not get the attention I felt it deserved. I also found it predictable that Harry Potter style situations such as all Weasleys being nice, and the Blacks being rude were kept. I feel it might've made a stronger point that not all members of a family are the same across time, as well as making the plot a little less predictable. \nThese things said I did still fully enjoy the game. Many side quests and main quest adventures keep you interested and engaged, and I grew attached to Ominous (a perfect example of a family-line break, well done!) and Sebastian, despite Sebastian's fall into dark tendencies, and found their plot the most interesting in the game. Characters were well diversified and even extras had interesting dialogue I found myself stopping to listen to. \nI would recommend this game to any Harry Potter fan and I did vastly enjoy it, despite my critics of the plot ending.

The clean graphics, fantastic sounds and intuitive game play make for an enjoyable and unique gaming experience. Harry Potter fans will be rewarded with a beautifully rendered Hogwarts Castle, complete with classrooms, miles of corridors, winding staircases, secret passages, hidden rooms and more; all beautifully rendered with movie-worthy content. (Sometimes on a grander scale than the movies) \n\nThe acting and interaction with the game characters are well done and very forgiving on any choices made in dialogs, so feel free to treat others kindly or rudely depending upon your taste. For serious gamers, the spell-based combat system works well and is both entertaining & challenging, while lower difficulty settings can give less experienced players some breathing room. \n\nAfter being sorted into your house, you will begin casting spells, such as Leviosa to make things/enemies float; and get plenty of combat practice attack dummies and wizarding duals. Aside from spell casting, players will learn how to craft and use potions, for healing, boosting stats and more. Additionally, players will learn herbology and learn how to grow combat ready plant-life like screaming mandrake root. Oh, and did I mention flying? Once you progress enough in your studies, you will take your first flight lesson and soon you\u2019ll be soaring over the wonderfully rendered school grounds and surrounding lands. \n\nFinally, the Village of Hogsmeade fills in nearly everything else for a complete wizarding world. Your first visit to this village will be to get your first wand but will get lost in the wild angled buildings and cobblestone streets right out of a fairytale. Considered the world\u2019s only Wizarding village, it\u2019s the only place you can find chocolate frogs, a cold butter beer, or easily buy missing potion ingredients. So much more too, such as capturing creatures and your own pocket worlds to tame and breed them, along with mountains of side quests, puzzles, and mini games.  \n \nIn conclusion, it\u2019s always nice to buy a game that delivers as promised, is well tested and bug free; but even better when it\u2019s done with the highest quality and effort to bring a fictional world to life. While there is always room for improvement and with millions of copies sold, I\u2019m sure there will be plenty of suggestions, Hogwarts is a solid addition to anyone\u2019s gaming library.", "timestamp_created": 1677814768, "timestamp_updated": 1677815018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504999995231628418", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133953328": {"recommendationid": "133953328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198837805318", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 203, "playtime_at_review": 203, "last_played": 1677807760}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome graphically, great open world experience, easy to get a handle on the combat.

Great visuals, fair character customization and player choice incorporated into the dialogue. Love the variety of appearance customization available (although I wish there were an outfit creator). Exploration feels interesting enough and the story/characters kept me engaged. I really liked how the 4 different trials didn't feel like the same thing over and over. Definitely was happy to find out that #3 and #4 weren't just more archway puzzles and stone golems. But the best part is the combat--incredibly fun and plenty of room for many different playstyles.\n\nMy #1 complaint about it however, is the fact that playing as any other house besides Slytherin feels rather out of theme. There are two main reasons for this:\n1. The Slytherin relationship questline is the longest and most well developed. This questline includes more house history/lore, more characters of the same house, and even includes epilogue conversations, making it feel like a much bigger part of the story than the other houses.\n2. Learning and using Unforgivable Curses has no consequences whatsoever, and not even your professors seem to bat an eye at it. Additionally, they are overpowered to the point of trivializing almost everything when paired with the Dark Arts talents. It is by far the most powerful build from a strict combat efficiency standpoint. Based on what I know of the Harry Potter mythos, I really can't imagine anyone from any other house being okay with learning these curses and using them so liberally, or even with just killing so many people and things at all. \n\nSo this game really needs a morality system that incurs some kind of penalty or impact on players based on the choices they make including whether they chose to learn and use Unforgivables or not. It also needs alternative combat resolution that would allow players to incapacitate instead of kill, and whether you choose to kill opponents or not would have an impact on the story. Something similar to Mass Effect's paragon/renegade system, where certain kinds of choices would contribute to a score that impacted which choices would be available in future quests, and how other characters react to the player. It also could have used more development/history for the other houses besides Slytherin. Especially Ravenclaw. We only go on 1 quest with our Ravenclaw friend. \n\nAnyway my advice to the prospective player is that if you want the most authentic experience, just play as a Slytherin, because this game seems to have been designed with a Slytherin protagonist in mind more than any other house. If you hate Slytherin too much, then just ignore the Unforgivable Curses and their associated questline.", "timestamp_created": 1677805762, "timestamp_updated": 1677810384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133947796": {"recommendationid": "133947796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273550241", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1009, "playtime_at_review": 1875, "last_played": 1677814429}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game really love story line along with all the places you can visit the only thing i have against it is the broom fly controls, but that could just be me don't really play a lot of flying games", "timestamp_created": 1677805693, "timestamp_updated": 1677805693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133947705": {"recommendationid": "133947705", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983797560", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2265, "playtime_at_review": 1858, "last_played": 1677875934}, "language": "english", "review": "fantastical", "timestamp_created": 1677805534, "timestamp_updated": 1677805534, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133947531": {"recommendationid": "133947531", "author": {"steamid": "76561199477738450", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1065, "playtime_at_review": 888, "last_played": 1677865992}, "language": "english", "review": "epic game", "timestamp_created": 1677805220, "timestamp_updated": 1677805220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133947514": {"recommendationid": "133947514", "author": {"steamid": "76561199155226817", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 545, "playtime_at_review": 1886, "last_played": 1677809343}, "language": "english", "review": "nice", "timestamp_created": 1677805190, "timestamp_updated": 1677805190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133947458": {"recommendationid": "133947458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815525679", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1948, "playtime_at_review": 3654, "last_played": 1677804906}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

There are kinks i hope the devs plan to address after all the SKUs are released (sorry & shoutout to my PS4, Switch and Xbox One compadres) and i cannot wait to see what they cook up with DLCs! i know we wont hear anything regarding DLC until AT LEAST a week after the Switch release (July 25th, 2023) but they seemed to add TONS of NPC comments alluding to other wizarding schools, beasts, and potential storylines that dont seem to go anywhere as of now but were clearly meant to eventually be followed up on. for example: how much we hear/learn about Uagadou, an idea i have for the devs is to implement a quest/storyline (preferably id rather a full expansion DLC but ill take a quest) that takes you there to rescue an elusive beast or something like that. Anyways, if you are a true fan and respect the deep lore of HP/the wizarding world like I do, you will absolutely fall in love with this game!! i typically play 'cozy life sim games' (dreamlight valley/the sims 4/animal crossing) so i was kinda worried about the battles and stuff like that there would be since thats not the type of gameplay i like or play, i was expecting to be awful at it but the devs did a fantastic job at making this playable regardless of what level or style of 'gamer' you are, its something i REALLY appreciated. I actually recently graduated from 'story mode' to 'easy mode' and tbh im pretty proud of that lol. THIS GAME IS GREAT. ******also you DO NOTTTTT need to know any of the lore going into this game!!!! anything you need to know is very well explained to you in-game BUT if you do happen to be a nerd for lore (i know i am) youll find tons of little comments/nods to the canon!****** PS THANK YOU FOR CHANGING THE RAVENCLAW HOUSE SYMBOL TO AN EAGLE.

The combat is highly enjoyable, though I would prefer greater diversity of enemy behavior. The main story isn't anything overly intricate, but the overall narrative is solid, and while many side quests do ultimately boil down to \"fetch quests,\" I often found myself enjoying the story arc of these side missions enough to put off main mission quests for hours.\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone, but especially for those who grew up with the books and movies; the level of nostalgia is undeniable. Interestingly, this attachment to the source material can easy break the other way for those directly effected by the abhorrent beliefs of the original books' author. I understand this position and will never be able to say anything to lessen the sting of being of being betrayed by an author who wrote a wonderful story about inclusion, love, and good always winning in the end.\n\nTo conclude: I loved this game experience, and f*** J.

There's one that reminds you to equip better gear, even if you don't have better gear. What if I want to use shit gear?\n- You can hide the whole UI, except for the combat feats UI: you WILL play the game the way the developers want you to play\n\n[h1]The characters are all very sassy[/h1]\n- Again, the ever talking characters: they must comment on everything, they must make the same observations for the millionth time over, the stupid fast travel boomer bitch must comment on your field guide every time, our main character keeps talking about Merlin trials - no, the Merlin trials are not a good surprise, and stop wondering if it's a Merlin trial you're looking at, it is, because we've done about 40 of them and they all look the same and the first 10 or so were fun but now they're fucking annoying.\n\n[h1]The game should have been 30 hours long[/h1]\n- Speaking of kinda cool things that become fucking annoying, this game has plenty of them: Merlin trials, Demiguise statues, treasure vaults with shit loot, the list goes on and on. This game does not have enough content to be a 40+ hour game, and it's clear they stretched as much as they could.\n\n\n[h1]Hogwarts Impact? Genshin Legacy?[/h1]\n- Speaking of Merlin trials again, their very existence kinda sucks in the first place. It's not because they're bad, I like the \"puzzles\" and they would've been fine if you did them only once or twice. The problem is that you do them for nothing, really. You have limited gear slots, and to get more slots you need to do the Merlin trials. So you must do these stupid things over and over again, and your reward is to loosen a limitation that adds absolutely nothing to the game.\n- The game also imposes limitations on how many animal types you can have in your vivarium. Why? What's the reasoning for this? How does this make the game more fun? It does not even make it more challenging.\n- The game has many more limitations, to the point where you have to wonder: was this game meant to be a live service game? Did they intend to allow you to buy time skips? Buy more gear slots? Buy an increase to the amount of animal types you can have in the vivarium? Buy more alchemy table slots? Buy more [insert any other game limitation]... ?\n\nSo good game, but filled with shit ideas, like pineapple pizza or some shit like that.", "timestamp_created": 1677799906, "timestamp_updated": 1677822154, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430107533931732178", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133944174": {"recommendationid": "133944174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101278326", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1277, "playtime_at_review": 867, "last_played": 1677840699}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely fantastic!

The world is massive and well fleshed out but it is padded by boring tasks but that's fine because there only optional. A lot of the trails just have the same boss over and over again there's not that much variety. Even on hard, the game felt easy to beat would like harder difficulties. But honestly, they just need to improve the enemies there very one note. But my biggest problem with the game is the choices have zero impact. I felt like no matter what I chose the story would have ended the same. I knew going into this game they had unforgivable curses and you can choose to be evil but all of it felt meaningless when it comes to the end. I chose to open the volt and said that I wanted to become all-powerful for it to still end with a happy ending. I never even got in trouble for pushing Sebastian to do evil or learning all the unforgivable curses. I think the biggest problem with this game is trying to be lore friendly because in order for this to be canon you can't go around killing teachers, after killing Ranrok take over the school or the world. I don't even know the point of the ending cutscene because I took in the evil energy for it to end like a normal school year. I even used Avada Kedavra on Hollow just for him to not die, apparently we have another boy who lived.

But then, it turned out to be a quite disappointing. For starters, I am a HP fan (books, movies, art, theories, merch, etc.) and I was so so so hoping that the game would be amazing. CAREFUL, SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nTHE SETTING \nAs you may know, it\u00b4s 1800s something, Scotland. You have the castle, Hogsmeade, and locations around, and veryyyyy far away, I\u00b4d say. There are 4 Houses, as usual, and a bunch of teachers, and an annoying Headmaster. For 19th century Scotland, Hogwarts is pretty diverse nationality-wise: Korea, Japan, Uganda, Persia(?). I guess we all know why they were added lol. It is still a bit weird considering the history of the countries, but okay. But why leave the rest, I ask? Where is, for example, Laos lol? Eastern Europe? South America? Native people? Diversity for the sake of it, I see.\n\nSCHOOL SETTING\nThe students that I saw looked like my age. I couldn\u2019t make whether there were anyone from the 1st year or older. There are no regular classes. You attend only a handful of them, and mostly they are like short videos. And they are not even funny, every time all the students are amazed and smiling, and everybody completes everything. Even though there is a school uniform, you don\u2019t get to wear it, because the gear consists of completely different pieces (headwear, robes, facewear, etc.) and, boy, are they ugly. I swear, there is any asylum mask as a choice, and I just have one questions: why? Why would you add an asylum mask as an option to wear over someone\u2019s mouth?\n\nEven though you get the sorting ceremony, it is short, very short. You can\u2019t sit at the table, you sleep on the ground, at night, in the Forbidden Forest for the sake of waiting for someone. You can\u2019t even go to bed. The only thing you get to do is to eat and drink, but that\u00b4s it. You can\u00b4t choose a pet (which would be great, but not in this game). There is no quiddich, but you do get to fly. You are not required to attend classes every day, and... there is no scoring system! Meaning, you broke the rules? You were awarded the points? It doesn\u2019t matter, because no one keeps track of them. Will. Care. There is no fear of being caught (only when a quest needs it), so it makes the game pretty uninteresting. No cauldron duty, for pity\u2019s sake! This is the most disappointing for me, because what was making HP exciting is also strict school system. Even I get that you can\u2019t put the classes in the game and expect me to explore the mines without any consequences, but at least sneaking around the castle at night should have some sort of punishment. In books and movies we saw how teachers were patroling the school, and here it is absolutely absent. Oh, one more thing: you can enter teacher\u2019s classroom and empty their trunks and chests while they are there watching you! You steal from your teachers so easily and nobody says a word about it. \n\nSTORYLINE AND QUESTS\nThe main story is okay, it\u2019s not the best, it\u2019s not the worst, about 20 hours to complete it. Side quests are mostly boring, some of them are interesting and fun. >!Personally, I loved rescuing animals, but!< the majority are mundane and tedious tasks lie go and talk to someone, fetch this, find this, etc. They could have done better job with side quests, honestly, because there are lots of them (~ 2/3 of the hours are SQ) and they start to feel uninteresting pretty quickly. Almost all quests require some sort of a puzzle based on logic and observations, but they are very, very repetitive. It gets to the point where you do not enjoy it anymore, and they are not even that hard. As game progresses and your level increases puzzles remain at the same level. And what is more, even when you are accompanied by your friend they do not do anything. Absolutely nothing. They are like a dead weight and I would have done a great job without them. They can fight, but they do not do much damage, and most of the enemies will attack only you.\n\nCHARACTERS \nHere I come, hold your seat belt. The characters are flat. Not just flat, they are FLAT. They almost have no personality at all, and their traits are almost identical. The only 2 people I can distinguish from the game are Sebastian and Ominous. Now, remember that the school is full of teenagers from 11 to 17. You will not see any behaviour like that from them. They behave and talk like super formal adults, even their gesture. Every time I see like my character clasps her hands together (every dialog) it makes me so irritated. Where are emotions? Where are bad words? Where is different personality through body language? Where is whining? \n\nGAMEPLAY\nCombat is okay. Again, could have been better, but it is not bad. The spells are diverse, and you need to know which enemy reacts to what better. There are also combos and ancient magic stuff. You cannot cast a spell (only Revelio) while on your broom and while ducking, which can be pretty inconvenient at times. There is never enough space. I completed [/spoiler]Merlin[/spoiler] trails and expanded the gear, but it seems never enough. There is no storage room or something in the Room of Requirements, which is kinda weird - if it know what I need, why can\u00b4t it give me a closet? It has enough space to create [spoiler]reservations for animals[/spoiler], but my character doesn\u2019t even get a closet. \n\nI have a big issue with Alohomora. I play on my PC, and opening every lock becomes boring quickly. It is the same mechanics for all three levels of locks, and there are a lot of them. Besides, we all know how Hermione used Bombarda to free Sirius, why not let us use the same spell for at least some lock of the 1st level?\n\nQuests have location limitations, and if you left it, you will get 15 seconds to return. I fell of the cliff a few times during combat and had to crazily rush around in order to make. When I use Disillusionment charm and become kinda invisible, my character makes so much noise while jumping or climbing, that I suspect the goblins are all deaf in reality and use magic to hear sounds. The dialogs during walking and under the charm are super loud only for Sebastian to say afterward: silent as a grave. Animals and [spoiler]animal rescuing[/spoiler] are a big part of the game, but you are not allowed to pet them. They will have a toy (a ball) and you will use a magic brush to do the job, but you can\u2019t actually play or pet them, and bond. Flying is a bit awkward. There is no quick save (I love quick saves). \n\nMORAL CHOICES\nNone. Nothing. NOTHING. The dialogs mostly have 2 options - be good or be bad, and neither influences on the outcome. You can cast all the Unforgivable curses ANYWHERE in front of ANYONE  and there will be no reaction, no punishment, no consequences. [spoiler]There is no option to become bad or even morally gray, you end up being good savior, happy ending, serve me my champagne.[/spoiler] Even though you kill people in the game, it doesn\u2019t affect your character in the slightest. You get it?  [spoiler]Your character will go on killing mages and goblins, and wild animals, you end up being all fluffy and saint, while[/spoiler] HP is all about morality and consequences (direct or indirect) and how those choices will haunt you later on. \n\nGAME ISSUES \nIt crashed 1 time. Sometimes, dueling feats don\u2019t register the progress. Never had any stuttering. Some items like gold, chests, bags are half int the ground, and I can\u2019t open them. Had some issues with the map, where it didn\u00b4t want to show the final route and I had to reopen it 3 times. \n\n(Not serious) And spiders. People, I hate spiders, I hate insects, and there are tons of those spiders in the game. Somehow, the spiders had more details that people\u2019s faces and emotional displays, so I was shoooook. Needless to say, I was playing and eating my comfort food all the time lol.", "timestamp_created": 1677794820, "timestamp_updated": 1677795184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133940734": {"recommendationid": "133940734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018142765", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1377, "playtime_at_review": 3399, "last_played": 1677815189}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever", "timestamp_created": 1677794761, "timestamp_updated": 1677794761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133940720": {"recommendationid": "133940720", "author": {"steamid": "76561199182212550", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 936, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 395, "playtime_at_review": 771, "last_played": 1677804742}, "language": "english", "review": "It`s so cool, i would absolutely recommend this to the harry potter`s fans and even to those who are not familiar with the magic world :)", "timestamp_created": 1677794740, "timestamp_updated": 1677794740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133940644": {"recommendationid": "133940644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071528263", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2307, "playtime_at_review": 5592, "last_played": 1677809064}, "language": "english", "review": "This shit slaps", "timestamp_created": 1677794628, "timestamp_updated": 1677794628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133940533": {"recommendationid": "133940533", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992267833", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 7293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2924, "playtime_at_review": 7293, "last_played": 1677559076}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I have played in a long, long time.

consequences this is by far the most immersive game i've played in a long time. you can make your own choices and avoid getting into trouble or you can bully everyone and be an asshole. you can choose not to learn unforgivable curses too. \nthere are puzzles and Mazes, breath of the wild shrine-like corridors, you can tame beasts like newt scamander and explore a gigantic open world map that is even more stunning than the soundtrack. combat system is kinda meh tbh. it's very hard to select your target and if you don't bind your spell slots well it can be nightmarish fighting 8 people and a troll. the characters are believable and the facial expressions are realistic, heartbroken they don't have professor flitwick but the current charms professor gives me robin williams vibes so that's fine. all in all This game really ensnared me like no other. i have never been so obsessed with anything and i rarely progress far in games but this is everything iv'e ever wanted since i was 6 years

From the moment I loaded up the game, I was transported to a stunningly detailed and immersive rendition of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and I felt like I was truly living out my own magical adventure.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are incredibly well-crafted, with a mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and combat that keeps things fresh and engaging throughout. Whether I was exploring the Forbidden Forest, duelling with other students in the Hogwarts courtyard, or brewing potions in the dungeons, I was always thoroughly engaged and entertained.\n\nOne of the things I loved most about Hogwarts Legacy, however, was the sense of agency it gave me as a player. Rather than simply following a linear story, I was able to make choices that affected the outcome of the game, shaping my own Hogwarts experience in a way that felt unique and personal.\n\nOf course, the real star of Hogwarts Legacy is the world itself. Every inch of Hogwarts and the surrounding areas are meticulously detailed, and it's clear that the developers poured their hearts and souls into creating a truly immersive and believable wizarding world. From the iconic Hogwarts Castle to the bustling streets of Hogsmeade, every location feels authentic and full of life, and I often found myself simply wandering around and taking in the sights and sounds.\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend Hogwarts Legacy enough. It's a fantastic addition to the wizarding world, and it's clear that the developers put an incredible amount of love and care into creating an experience that truly captures the magic of Hogwarts. Whether you're a die-hard fan or a newcomer to the series, I have no doubt that you'll find yourself enchanted by this wonderful game.", "timestamp_created": 1677783924, "timestamp_updated":
