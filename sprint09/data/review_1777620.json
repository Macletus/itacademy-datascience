There's a lot of good here but also a fair amount of bad. I'm going to get the parts of the game I do not like out of the way first so anyone reading this knows what the sour parts of the game were for me personally and then can weigh it against the later positives in order to make a decision on whether or not to buy it.\n\n- Cons\n\nThe dungeon design in this game is abysmal. Dungeon's like these would have been expected back in the early Playstation 1 days but nowadays? No. Dungeons are linear, boring, and repetitive. The biggest offender of it for me is the \"Soul Matrix\" side dungeon that allows you to unlock skills for members of your party. The rewards for getting through it are worth it, but it's a slog every step of the way. Genuinely would rather go through Tartarus in P3 again instead of dealing with another obnoxious teleporter \"puzzle\".\n\nThe story is painfully short. I beat the entire game in just under 50 hours and that's with me doing every request, getting 91% on the compendium, upgrading my weapons to the max etc. Point is, I did almost everything. I really wish there was a bit more of the main story present in this game as it is the more interesting part of the game. The requests are all basically boiled down to \"go here, do one of three things, go back.\" Very few of the requests are unique and the ones that are do not stand out at all.\n\nLastly, day 1 DLC. While I didn't buy the game on day 1, the fact that DLC was released for it on its release date that added a decent chunk of story and content is extremely cringe. Atlus please stop cutting content just to resell it as DLC. \n\n- Pros\n\nThe soundtrack for this game goes hard. Really hard. Unsurprising considering most of the music Atlus does goes hard, but it should be stated nonetheless. \n\nCharacters are all well written and fun. While my opinion of some characters at the start was a bit mixed, towards the end of the game I genuinely really liked and cared for all of them. Ringo in particular is by far my favorite protag Atlus has made so far. I really like the snarky personality she was given, she's fun to listen to and I like how she interacts with the other members of the party a lot.\n\nStory while short is good, I just wish there was more of it like I said before. It has some really good twists I wasn't expecting and some pretty good story beats. Genuinely one of the better written stories Atlus has made in recent years.", "timestamp_created": 1676853787, "timestamp_updated": 1676853787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133125976": {"recommendationid": "133125976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259159975", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 4396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 130, "playtime_at_review": 4396, "last_played": 1676752051}, "language": "english", "review": "While this game doesn't have the same quality of plot like other mainline SMT or Persona games, it's still quite enjoyable due to the character interactions, soundtrack and aesthetic.

Had a few issues but overall a good game that does a lot of things better than a lot of other recent Atlus games. \n\nFirst off, the graphics. I love the visual style of this game. Its like P5 with its comic book aesthetic, but dialed to 100. The colors pop out very well. All the characters look extremely vibrant. My greatest praise goes to the demons. While using the same models as P5 and SMTV, with the use of colors and textures the demons look better then they ever have been. Going back to P5 after this makes that game look kinda dull. One thing this game does worse than P5 though is the UI design. P5 still clears this game in that sense, but the UI is still miles better than SMTV. \n\nThe music is also very good. Its not as good as the previous atlus game, but there still are a lot of good songs. The jewelery shop theme, all three of the boss themes, and the hideout theme come to mind the most. The reason for lack of songs is probably budget. \n\nNow for gameplay. I am going to get the negatives out of the way first. The dungeons suck. But, they arent as bad as people say. People went through p3 and p4's dungeons, and never complained, even though they were way worse. And do not tell me those games are old so its okay, all the Atlus games that preceded p3 and p4 had way better dungeons. While the dungeons in this game are bland mazes, they function as a place to do combat, which imo is amazing. \n\nThe combat in this game is amazing. I know people complained about human party members, but this game does them perfectly. Demons in this game function like Personas. You equip them to party members and they give you stat boosts, skills, and elemental affinities. How this is different than the modern Persona games is that finally every party member can change out their demon. In P3 having mc being the only one with more than one persona worked because of the AI party members, in p4 and p5 it sucked. All the party members might as well not be there as there is zero customization to them while the mc just does everything. It is so lame. Instead SH2 works like the older persona games, where you only have four party members who are all extremely customizable. Not only can each member freely use any demon, you can also customize them by increasing their elemental affinities and giving them accessories so each party member feels different. This customization goes into the gameplay as it really does have that SMT feel of making the perfect party to fight the boss, making it very satisfying. Managing your demons by fusing them is as fun as ever, especially since they brought back smtiv's fusion search functions. Ringo's Aion skills also add a lot of strategy. They allow fast swapping out of demons like in Persona, but puts a limit on it so its not OP. Another Aion skill is increasing stacks, which segways into the main battle mechanic. The Sabbath system. In this system when you get a weakness you build a stack. At the end of your turns you summon a demon for each stack and you can do an all out attack for a lot of damage. I really like this system since it becomes a puzzle for getting the most stacks. Later on you will unlock Aion skills and passive upgrades which give more stacks depending on if certain conditions are met. It becomes a puzzle to see how high you can get the stack. \n\nNow for story, I will keeo it brief to avoid spoilers. I really liked it. Its simple, has good twists, and is very personable to the characters. The characters are all interesting with their motives, and the writing quality is a leaps better than P5's (p5's writing is doo doo so ig its not a high bar). This game avoids p5's writing pitfalls by not having mean spirited humor, making all characters equally shine, and also being more concise. Characters mostly do not repeat the same plot points a million times. I also find the plot point of most people yearning the apocalypse interesting. Is it the best story ever told: no. But imo the plot still clears smtv, and persona 3-5.\n\nOverall I recommend this game. My only issues are the dungeons, and I guess the lack of budget. The side content also has that feeling but it still reinforces the satisfying gameplay loop. Another issue is the dlc, which is disgusting I agree. I still think the base game is good enough though, also p5 had 80 dollars worth of dlc which had even more overly priced costumes and op personas but no one cared for some reason. \n\nIn short, if you like the gameplay side of smt with fun battles, and if you like simple but satisfying stories, you will probablt like this game. Most of the issues are budget issues, and overall I was able to look past them. The hate is overblown for this game, reminds me of the TLOU2 hate, where people were more mad because the game wasnt what they were expecting.

The gameplay is okay, the demon encounters are.. frequent, the available demons and fusions are sufficient enough to make it through the game without major struggle. However, the story and it's pacing are far from perfect. I enjoyed the story, but there  is so much nothingness happening for the first half of the game, and then the story suddenly goes balls to the walls and gets interesting. Unfortunately, many players will probably lose interest before that point, especially when you consider that some of the dungeons are absolutely miserable. It's clear that some of them are designed to straight up waste your time and artificially prolong the game. If you can bear it until the end of the game, you will definitely be satisfied, as the story and everything does have a very good (and very Atlus-y) payoff. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1676210103, "timestamp_updated": 1676210103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508101820945739746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132566594": {"recommendationid": "132566594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133596655", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 1958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1958, "last_played": 1676070173}, "language": "english", "review": "this is never going to be worth $60+ \nbought persona 4 golden for $10 and it sweeps this shit easily \nevery smt game i played yet is better than this even raidou 1 without guide was more fun\nDon't buy it not worth at all.", "timestamp_created": 1676070480, "timestamp_updated": 1676070480, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485637634992599487", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "132465713": {"recommendationid": "132465713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148329808", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 3134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3134, "last_played": 1675939642}, "language": "english", "review": "Game's mid but I enjoyed it...

It's also not spectacular if you've played other games in the SMT universe. This game is a Cyberpunk interpretation of a SMT game. The world is quite interesting and the characters are well written. But just not enough time and effort was put into the game that it needed.\n\nTo summarize, the game seems like it had a great blueprint with a lot of potential on paper, but due to a shoestring budget or other reasons, the game was never given the chance to blossom. The world while interesting, is bare bones. You are not told enough about the events that led up to the world you are now inhabiting. \n\nThere aren't any Social Links/Confidants (Persona) to flesh out the world. Instead, you have one place that you can meet with your party members where you accumulate \"Soul Points\" in order to unlock gates in their respective mini-dungeons. The mini-dungeons of each character are repetitive and predictable.  \n\nSpeaking of the dungeons, they are also mundane. Each dungeon plays the same, and while they might have small differences in size and scope, they are essentially the same kind of place and suffer from severe repetition.\n\nThe story had potential but felt incomplete. The story, which is good on paper and could have had some really compelling moments, was held back by some instances of clumsy writing and the main event scripting which felt a bit rushed.\n\nThe only place the game shines is the gameplay. It's good ol' SMT Devil Summoner gameplay.

As a bridge between social sim Persona and Hardcore JRPG SMT, it does quite well. A solid 8, not groundbreaking but a fun time.\nThe main focus of the story is Ringo and her crew travailing a horrible stagnant and stale corporate future, in order to save mankind from causing its own destruction.\n\nThe gameplay is standard SMT/Persona fair, turn based combat plus creature collection. Its not particularly hard if you have any JRPG experience and tends to border on being too easy.\n\nThe world and dungeon design is not that good tbh. granted it sets the tone of living in a corporate and stagnant city , with a thin veneer of glamour masking the hollowed out reality of a post industrial city. Yet this boils down to a lot of corridors in train tunnels and empty corporate buildings when dungeon diving. Except the Soul matrix part of the game, which is more like long pathways in \"cyber space\" and teleporter puzzles. I enjoyed the soul matrix until I ran into those puzzles. I wish that they were just number/colour coded. My advise is save before you jump.\n\nOn the down sides, its a bit short, the teleporter puzzles suck and thats about it. I even liked the music , even if it was limited it wasn't grating. \n\nHOWEVER the DLC practices are obscene. If it wasn't for the high prices it could almost be forgiven, but locking away series regular demons was too much, it felt like whaling. Costumes and extra missions are one thing (not great behaviour, but all too common ) but that was a step too far.\n\nOther notes is that this port runs ok. You will get stutter on your first battle of that play session, but other then that its not too noticeable, when running around and such.\n\nOverall I did enjoy my time with it and 100% completed it. I liked the combat chatter from team mates and the enemies making the characters have bags of personality. I enjoyed the style of the character design and the music. The story is So-so to good, with great character moments thrown in and some good voice acting from Ringo and Milady's VA in particular. \n\nI look forward to any sequels that may come.\n\nI would say that this game is easily worth its money at \u00a330 or about that. I wouldn't bother with the DLCs at all. The challenge battles arn't worth it, though the character introduced is fun.\n", "timestamp_created": 1675193246, "timestamp_updated": 1675193246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.60877460241317749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131938216": {"recommendationid": "131938216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198991628798", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 851, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 259, "last_played": 1676119643}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1675168523, "timestamp_updated": 1675168523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131875935": {"recommendationid": "131875935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044089329", "num_games_owned": 1576, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 361, "last_played": 1675122114}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant", "timestamp_created": 1675092717, "timestamp_updated": 1675092717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131858791": {"recommendationid": "131858791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198383975747", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 327, "last_played": 1675471874}, "language": "english", "review": "it's alright, too simple for smt standards imo, but still better than smoking that mid-ass pokemon pack, the party dynamics are great as well, just buy it if you like jrpgs and good characters", "timestamp_created": 1675068906, "timestamp_updated": 1675068906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49714285135269165", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131849234": {"recommendationid": "131849234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198848458706", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 380, "last_played": 1675407086}, "language": "english", "review": "it a great game.", "timestamp_created": 1675052164, "timestamp_updated": 1675052164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491730839014053345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131826337": {"recommendationid": "131826337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010355407", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3063, "last_played": 1674910253}, "language": "english", "review": "I went into this game with tempered expectations and really enjoyed it.

All the criticisms are valid. I barely recommend. \n\nIf Soul Hackers was a riff on the earlier SMT formula, this is certainly based on SMT4. 3D environments, requests, etc. I couldn't help think of other games in the greater series when playing this.\n\nThe core feeling I got was Tartarus from Persona 3. I remember many, many hours of running around and grinding and without the cheat DLC, I'd sure be grinding SH2 right now. Two major problems are it reminds me of P3P, where most of the fun exploration was replaced by menus, and that many of the dungeons end up being blind teleporter mazes. \n\nThe story reminded me of Strange Journey not for any thematic reason, just it barely existed and the party members were basically \"Stupidly selfless\" good, \"Rage Against the Machine\" evil, and \"I'm not getting involved\" neutral. Similarly, the choice of endings (if there is one, I'm unsure) is a pick-a-path in the last 15 minutes of gameplay.\n\nCombat is overly simplified. Now weaknesses just add to a meter that does more damage at end of turn. It loses a lot of complexity and people interested in deep SMT tactical battles are out of luck.\n\nIt is graphically very nice and the voice acting is above average. I can see where the money went, but this is very much Atlus' B series, with their A price. \n\nI guess I had almost 28 hours in it, but as the game went on, I needed more and more frequent breaks. That's not the way things should be. I don't want my time back, but this is \"Pad playtime by grinding: The Game.\" Get it on sale, and be sure you're interested in grinding and obnoxious mazes.

Play any other megaten game instead of this one. The first Soul Hackers is better than this game and it released over 20 years ago. \n\nThe worst parts of this game is the long and boring dungeons that don't have any puzzles. All you do is run around for like 2 hours in a dungeon fighting enemies and doing some quests and after that you go to a new dungeon that feels the same as the previous one. Each dungeon tries to have it's own gimmik but the gimmik is never that fun. \n\nThe battle system is very simple and basic. It has the Sabbath mechanic but it didn't really do much. It's pretty much just an extra attack you can do after attacking an enemy's weakness. Other Megaten games have more interesting gameplay mechanics. \n\nThe story is okay but for me it was pretty predictable. The characters could also be more interesting than they are. \n\nWhen this game was announced, I was actually pretty excited. I have played every Devil Summoner game and enjoyed every game and I was looking forward to see how Atlus would expand this series. Instead Atlus created one of their worst games ever and because of the poor reviews and sales of this game, they might never make any new Devil Summoner games. \n\nThis game is also overpriced and has too much DLC. None of the DLC's are even good. Only get this game when it's on sale and if you want to expreience one of Atlus' worst games. Spend your money on a good game instead like any of the Persona games or Shin Megami Tensei III Nocturne.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about this game was the music and fusing demons and fighting bosses. But these things aren't unique to this game, fusing demons is something you can do in every Megaten game. Good music is something all Megaten games have, but the soundtrack in this game doesn't have that Megaten feel to it but I still liked it.", "timestamp_created": 1674265993, "timestamp_updated": 1674265993, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496651768684387207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131238771": {"recommendationid": "131238771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337459926", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 816, "last_played": 1676435553}, "language": "english", "review": "Beast Eye, Beast Eye, Concentrate, Beast Eye, Megidolaon", "timestamp_created": 1674261065, "timestamp_updated": 1674261065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530654549598693848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131200930": {"recommendationid": "131200930", "author": {"steamid": "76561199395016141", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 564, "playtime_at_review": 4588, "last_played": 1677505867}, "language": "english", "review": "i could love this way of visualizational skill and technique.  again i think this is quite nice way of trying making it all of that thought of things in game screen...it's quite improved! advanced!", "timestamp_created": 1674215126, "timestamp_updated": 1674215126, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50064849853515625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "131183593": {"recommendationid": "131183593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049201629", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4499, "last_played": 1674185675}, "language": "english", "review": "Mehh, very mediocre SMT experience.

There are a finite amount of these points available per playthrough, so playing multiple times to see it all is required.  The game also only has one real route through the main story so everything else will play the same, making the whole process even sillier.\n\nAll that being said, I DO still recommend the game.

I really hope that the MC in future games can be an actual character instead of a card board cut out going forward! If you just want a good looking game with a solid story then it's pretty good. This issues with the game come from the fact that it's an ATLUS game and has some siblings that are hard to be compared to.\n\nThis is NOT a Persona game, so if you are coming off of that Persona 5 PC release looking for a fix, you won't find it here. There's no life sim, and no dating. I honestly kind of feel the same can be said for Shin Megami fans looking for their next fix too, as this game lacks the press turn systems that create challenging but fair combat in that side of the franchise.\n\nInstead it uses a new system called the Stack that I think is interesting and forces you to utilize items more, but has some issues. The stack instead of giving you extra turns for exploiting a weakness creates a stack of damage that will be dealt at the end of your teams round, and there will sometimes be additional effects added to that depending on the demons you have. You will unlock more ways to make the stack stronger as the game progresses as well. Ultimately while I find the stack interesting it does not pair well with the typical difficulty of a Shin Megami game. I originally started playing on Hard, but had to switch it down to normal just because I felt the stack didn't give me enough agency to deal with the deadly enemies I was facing. Even on normal a lot of the fights didn't feel like the stack contributed enough to give me any sort of advantage or survivability. \n\nOverall I don't think this game is a bad game, but it's not your typical Shin Megami game. If you are aware of that I think you can come in and enjoy it for being a game with a good story, good characters, and great music.

So here's my take on it as someone who has recently gotten into the series starting with, of course, Persona 5. From there, I went on to play Persona 3, Persona 4, Persona 4 Golden, Persona 5 Strikers, and SMT3: Nocturne. I also played some of the non-RPG titles like all of the Persona dancing games and the fighting games. So that is where I am at in terms of the series. If you have been into the series for quite some time, then chances are that there are a lot of elements of this game that are going to turn you off and you are not going to like my review so may want to stop reading right about now. However, for those of you who are relatively new or are on the fence about this game due to negative reviews like I was, I feel that you should give this game a chance even if you have to wait for a sale. \n\nGameplay: This game is actually pretty damn fun - mainly because it still has that addicting SMT gameplay. In terms of difficulty, this is probably the easiest out of any of the SMT games that I have played as it is pretty easy to get demons that can resist any element. There plenty of side quests in addition to the main quest even though they don't really get anywhere that interesting in the end, but offer additional combat and rewards that can help make the game even easier and unlock certain dungeons/maps. If anything, I think this adds accessibility to the game especially for those that are not familiar with the SMT series or are not fans of the difficulty spike in certain games of the series especially towards the end. Those of you looking for that challenging SMT gameplay may want to skip this one. I'm personally into both the challenging games and this accessible level of difficulty for this game. There is also new game+ available so that adds some replayability to the game too. I personally don't do new game+ stuff anymore since I have limited time for video games these days. \n\nStory: It is your typical JRPG trope-filled prevent the end of the world with the power of friendship kind of storyline. The characters are pretty likeable in my opinion although a bit flat. They help make the atmosphere feel pretty chill unlike Nocturne where everything feels empty and depressing (yeah, I know it is supposed to be post-apocalyptic) even though some people are into that. To each their own.\n\nArt Direction: I like it. Personally, not a fan of the other SMT games with the gothic doll-like artwork so it was not hard for me to like the artwork in this. \n\nEnvironment/Level Design: Other people seem to think that the dungeons are repetitive or tedious. If you think that the level design is repetitive, then you need to play Dragon Age 2. If you think that the maps in this game are tedious, then you need to play SMT: Nocturne. \n\nMusic: Pretty good, but not Persona 3,4, or 5 level of good. \n\nPerformance: This game never had any form of instability and it never crashed for me. I feel like it was optimized well for the PC and I had smooth frame rates the whole time. The game did not seem to be graphically demanding in the first place evidence being that my GPU fans did not activate when I played this game and I am rolling with a 5600xt with a Ryzen 7 3700X when I played it. \n\nIf you are into ratings, then I would personally give this game an 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1673413261, "timestamp_updated": 1673413261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516644477844238281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130577551": {"recommendationid": "130577551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360380039", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4768, "last_played": 1673338219}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a good game.

Obtained true ending on both.\n\nFor context, Megaten has been my favorite video game franchise since 2015, and Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers is one of my favorite games in the entire franchise. When Soul Hackers 2 was announced in early 2022, I felt a combination of optimism and skepticism going into this game. On one hand, I was so happy that ATLUS was making a new Megaten game that wasn't Mainline SMT or Persona, which still gives me hope that there will be future games for other Megaten spinoffs (devil survivor 3 PLEASE)\n\nOn the other... this game looked like a very big departure from the first game. It took awhile to *somewhat* get over that hurdle for me, but once I did (and after going through the game twice), I can say that - while flawed from a dungeon crawling perspective, I really enjoyed my time with Soul Hackers 2.\n\nIn my opinion, I think that the best part of this game is the story, which might just be the best Megaten story since SMT IV. The main party of this game are some of the most charming characters I've seen from ATLUS, and Ringo might just be my favorite protagonist in all of Megaten. She's wonderful. The plot is simple, but works very well throughout most of the game due to solid writing and great voice acting. Furthermore, I appreciate the emphasis of Detective Work throughout the game, which is seen throughout all of Devil Summoner. While this doesn't feel like a Soul Hackers sequel in my opinion, I think this game works great as a Devil Summoner title (should've called it Devil Summoner: Aion)\n\nThe combat system called \"Sabbath\" is similar to the demon coop system in Strange Journey, and while it starts of slow, it really does open up greatly the more you progress through the game. While I don't think it's the best combat in Megaten, I find it to be very solid on its own and remains fun through the rest of the game.\n\nThe same cannot be said for the Dungeon Crawling. As a whole, these might be some of the worst dungeons in all of Megaten. The Soul Matrix (the game's optional dungeon which provides very powerful upgrades and additional story for the party) is the biggest offender to this. Boring designs, repetitive music and visual design, large amounts of dead/open space, etc. The main story dungeons also suffer from these issues, although as the game progresses, there is slightly more variety in both music and visual design. After the November Patch, dungeon crawling is less annoying with the addition of a sprint button, but this only mitigates the bad dungeon crawling. Coming directly after SMT V (where the open areas of Da'at had really incredible level design), it's crazy how much of a stepback this game was.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time with this game. Soul Hackers 2 goes on sale often, so if you're a fan of ATLUS or are just looking for a solid JRPG, I do recommend buying it! Although reception and sales were middling for this game, I do hope for future titles in Megaten that aren't Mainline SMT and Persona. Personally, I think it's likely with how well SMT V and the P5R ports sold, so I'm looking forward to what's next from ATLUS.", "timestamp_created": 1673050138, "timestamp_updated": 1673050138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577749073505401611", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "130268078": {"recommendationid": "130268078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025429303", "num_games_owned": 676, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 255, "last_played": 1672829293}, "language": "english", "review": "Very disappointing.

I did have fun however noticing its flaws, played few other well known Shin Megami Tensei titles, Soul Hackers 2 didn't exactly grasped me like the first Soul Hackers. What makes Soul Hackers unique from other SMT titles and Persona? \n\nFirstly, we all know Status Aliments is a common thing however one Aliment \"Bomb\" is only in Soul Hackers. To see it back in Soul Hackers 2 made it exciting, as well for demons in a unique race name \"Zomas\" that was later mention in the story. However I knew the \"Demon Compendium\" didn't have a whole lot of demons like SMTV, not even ONE \"Zoma\" to fuse for. The hype for it died down for it. A returning character from the first Soul Hackers, and Devil Summoner came in and that was \"Madame Ginko\" but in all honestly, I just wasn't hype for it unfortunately, same applies for Yatagarasu and Phantom Society. Vision Quests are back but I find first Soul Hackers to be more entertaining. \n\nThe characters from your party are great, the voice acting is fantastic. Saizo has relationship problems and shows how being a devil summoner messes/changes your life, which made me love a lot. Milady is cold, hides information from the group, eventually later gets expose on some stuff but all of that would've been solve if she just opens up to them a little more, especially since the dire situation everyone is in. Arrow is average, don't hate him, don't love him either. Couple moments where I was hype for him. Ringo has amazing personality and succeeds serving as a protagonist that always puts a smile on my face. Picking out choices as her is great to see her reaction. Voice acting amazing. Figue unfortunately didn't get enough screen time until the climax happens, eventually making me dislike her. Other adversaries that oppose Ringo and the gang are good, Iron Mask and his Zenon was good, both of their looks awesome. Without spoiling much, his writing could've use some work, but I love seeing him whenever I got the chance too. \n\nStory felt/is repetitive since the first person that died, and this kept going throughout. It was horrible because I'd really love to see more about the characters, how they got there, how they die ETC. If they did this, it probably would make me care about the characters lot more and get an understanding what sort of motive they wanted to aim at. Ichiro onda for example since the beginning, his slight shown of Braze made me want to know more about him, along with Arrows Sensei. The Developers love having their characters say \"Soul Hackers\". \n\nThe day one DLC was a disaster, especially when they announced DLC from previous Soul Hackers cosmetics, a favorite character, and well known demons that SHOULD'VE already been in the game BASE. So no thank you. \n\nGameplay; unfortunately it wasn't challenging. Hit a weakness, hit more weaknesses, you deal more damage from what's known as \"Sabbaths\" or \"Stacks\" if you're only a persona fan, basically an \"All Out-Attack!\" move. Yes, the battle is that of Persona look, you get four party members equip with demons with little stuff. Landing a improper move in battle, they don't punish you for it unlike SMT or even PERSONA games. You just get rewarded for it as long as you have a demon to block that move incase the enemy reflects on it. You don't lose a Stack, the enemy doesn't get stronger, NOTHING like that, so then the battles just feels.. well.. boring. Sometimes I wish it was just Ringo or with Arrow and Four/Three other demons which you don't see in battle unless its a Sabbath. If it had more actual team building, it would've been more fun, but Soul Hackers 2 just didn't have any sadly. No momentum/flow at all. If it were to have first Soul Hackers battle system, battles would've been NUTS. Little interaction with characters like reviving an ally, making jokes during battle was entertaining. Some may find it annoying, it can get old but I personally didn't mind. Customizing your COMPS was actually really fun for me! \n\nDungeons; My god where do I begin. It was very repetitive, boring, last dungeon looked appealing. I disliked the Soul Axis dungeons, the portals were disgusting. I had to look up a guide online in order to pick which portal that would lead me to a gate. This made SMTV exploration look like a masterpiece to be honest. The Matrix doesn't chance at all, not even giving a little personality base around the character you wish to visit. Heck if they even add a red color in the background, I'd notice a little difference. The Music was the same thing, Matrix, if an enemy ambushes you, regular battle theme, EVEN when facing the bosses. I really wish it was different, R.S maybe having a hip hop battle theme, those bosses have the same music, god even Iron Mask bro. Missed Opportunity like how? It's a SIN. Dungeons hardly have any traps, and not enough puzzles. It sucks. Navigator to warn you enemies near by was super annoying. If they just left it out and keep a signal on right corner that changes colors showing you're on the clear or not, I'd be happy for cause I can see game, thank you. \n\nAnyways, lots of repetitive stuff in this game. I feel little emotional by characters but wasn't enough. I knew not to expect much from Atlus making 3D. I don't know how they didn't do it well on this one despite making great sellers in the past SMT that are 2D. I'm more emotional on that than the game itself. Please do better Atlus, I know you can, it's just not this one sadly. 6/10 \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1672207431, "timestamp_updated": 1672207431, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623940646648406982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129483361": {"recommendationid": "129483361", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972502096", "num_games_owned": 645, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 428, "last_played": 1673669544}, "language": "english", "review": "What in the ghost in the shell stand alone complex evangelion akira shit - if I didn't know any better, I'd say Hideaki Anno himself wrote the script.

Sure, Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner: Soul Hackers 2 is a long and ridiculous name, but at least it might get people who know about SMT interested in the first Soul Hackers, older Devil Summoner games or just Megaten in general.\n\nHighly enjoying it so far though. It feels like a cyberpunk coated SMT4 with some Persona elements and more dungeon crawler than city sprawler.

The overall experience was around 6/10 in my opinion.\nAfter finally getting my hands on and devouring Persona 4, I decided to check and see what else Atlus has been up to. I\u00b4d never even hear d of Soul Hackers before this and from the demo footage it looked kinda cool. Now it\u00b4s 60 something hours later, and my opinion boils down to a resounding ''meh''. \n\nThe story itself starts of well enough, introducing interesting concepts and showing a fair bit of promise. Unfortunately it seems content to never really explore some plot points, there are a fair few cases of loose threads just being left hanging, and by the halfway point it seems as if the story was being rushed violently to it\u00b4s conclusion. The characters likewise show a lot of promise, and in true Atlus style there are a few systems in place to help the player spend time with and get to know them better. Unfortunately I never found myself becoming invested in any of them, and any character motivations came of as fairly dull at best. There are a fair few things to enjoy about them on the surface, but when you begin to dig there really isn\u00b4t to much to find.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself it should be nothing to unfamiliar from Persona, although it felt more akin to Shin Megami Tensei. You have a fairly decent hub world to explore, various NPCs to interact with, quests to complete, it\u00b4s all here. the demon summoning allows for a fair bit of customization, depending on the situation at hand and a persons playstyle. Each character has strengths and weaknesses that can be offset to a degree, but never enough as to remove their individual identities. There is a bit of an issue of character dialogue getting quite repetitive, and that problem unfortunately persists throughout the entire game. I found myself playing the game more with the sound turned off during the more grindy sections, with the final boss suffering badly from this problem.\n\nMain story line is relatively straightforward and easy to track. Most all of the plot twists that occurred are anything but subtle, although I will give the game props for one or two that did catch me by surprise. The side quests are your standard fair for these kinds of games, but I will give props for the NPC\u00b4s actually being given character development. A fair few will give multiple side quests of similar nature, but with an overarching story all of their own the progresses along with the main story.\n\nI could speak of this game further, but as a whole this feels as though it is one is a hit-or-miss kind of situation. I can\u00b4t say I enjoyed it particularly, but that does no mean the game has no redeemable qualities. Far from it. I would say if you\u00b4re a fan of Atlus\u00b4 other work, I\u00b4d say you should think about giving this one a look. Definitely not one I would recommend paying full price for, but do pick it up when it goes on sale and give it a whirl. I can\u00b4t in good conscience recommend going out of your way to complete it, but if you just stick to the main story and a few side quests, I believe it should help to kill a few hours.\nIt by no means should be compared to it\u00b4s siblings, but taken as it\u00b4s own thing. An interesting venture into exciting waters, but ultimately it seems more interested in floating on stagnating waters, rather than raising the sails and catching it\u00b4s wind.\nI would love to see what this series could become with some time and a fair bit of polish.", "timestamp_created": 1671996856, "timestamp_updated": 1671996856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578135550022125244", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129101285": {"recommendationid": "129101285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104372546", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1671807094}, "language": "english", "review": "As an Atlus fan, I hate to say this, but It's not fun at all. \n\nRingo hot tho.", "timestamp_created": 1671808575, "timestamp_updated": 1671809324, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580327033996582031", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "129076395": {"recommendationid": "129076395", "author": {"steamid": "76561199124507282", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2140, "last_played": 1671775420}, "language": "english", "review": "uhh its okay", "timestamp_created": 1671779356, "timestamp_updated": 1671779356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453608244657516479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128931037": {"recommendationid": "128931037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198740736760", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3401, "last_played": 1671575191}, "language": "english", "review": "its a good game", "timestamp_created": 1671569825, "timestamp_updated": 1671569825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.413688302040100098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "128859843": {"recommendationid": "128859843", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152700360", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 3092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3092, "last_played": 1671454469}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty solid game despite being a lower budget title from ATLUS.

I loathed Figue, but that was almost a given. The story and worldbuilding made no sense. Everybody just blindly accepted the exposition dumps about an all-knowing AI, the conflict was basic and unnuanced, the final villain and their motivation made me roll my eyes (although the villain before that wasn't any better). It seems very clear to me that Arrow was meant to be the protagonist at one point, with how the story centered around him as much as it did, but he wasn't any more fleshed out than the others.\n\nI also wish I'd gone with my gut for the \"normal\" ending.

But after months dreading to return to it, I just gotta get it off my chest. Atlus rushes a RPG to further boost sales. It seemed too good to be true that two Atlus games came out in the same year.\n\nGameplay: Fun for the hardcore turn-based rpg players. For all others it will come off as a grueling dungeon crawl slug. I love a good grind but this game made me rethink that.\nLevels/Worlds: Very nice designs, just wish they were a bit shorter. After a point everything looks the same and there isn't any events to liven up the rest of the crawl.\nCharacters: Ringo is obviously the strongest character, and it is nice to finally have a main character with their own personality. That being said at some points she's just too good? Too strong? It is clear they put all of their focus into the main character as the side characters are nothing but their tropes. Your side members exist just so you have the 4 party scheme of persona. Honestly you could go a more mainline SMT approach and that would take the bland characters out of the spotlight. Figue was my second favorite but the story reduces her to the sidelines for no reason other than a spoiler reason at the end of the game with very little pay off. Fuck the bird, easy to spot a cash grab mascot and this is the most bland attempt yet. It is just a drone for Figue and is tied to a shitty mechanic.\nVoices: Being unable to turn off the notifications of enemy awareness is too taxing. I get the use, just let me turn it off. I played the game on mute after a point just to avoid it. YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED, YOU HAVE LOST SIGHT OF THE---, YOU HAVE BEEN SPOTTED. I played with the english dub voice acting and I'm sorry for them that they had to voice this game but at least they tried.\nGraphics: I thought this was the area the game would struggle in but this is where the game performs. Everything is visually appealing and smooth, I think the cell shading helps but I could see where someone who hates anime style with a passion would get tired. \nAtmosphere: The game really hits the bright neon notes and a striking visual backdrop, but after a while things start to look the same. I wish there were areas that weren't as future or fantasy to show just how much things have advanced but every square inch screams \"FUTURE FUTURE FUTURE\"\nStory: Interesting to a point. They really push the \"technology has exceeded further than humans know what to do with and no new inventions will ever exist again\" and then it just pretends we didn't discuss that for over half the game. For a society that has peaked, we don't see anything new from our world that could exist. It is a modern day world with a futuristic coat of pain and cyberpunk just ain't my thing.\nGrind: Too much without DLC, Too easy with DLC. I like a good grind but other than the numbers going up the battle abilities are story progression locked and you only get a certain amount. Hope for 30 hours you were planning ahead! Which is another thing, imagine if this game was over 30 hours long and you still had to grind just as much. Makes me shutter. If only they spaced it out to a 100 hour RPG with better pacing.\nDLC: Absolutely required. Can't beat the game without it.

It kinda does its own thing separate from all recent SMT titles (no turn shenanigans), and it does it okay.\n\nDungeon exploration is pretty bland, not helped by the lack of diversity in dungeon designs and soundtracks. The general direction of the game is a bit aimless in what it tries to convey about the state of the world. The plot fares much better as a personal story for the main cast than as a game with a broad message about society.\n\nThe game is solid overall, but more so because it has a lot of uneven parts that balance themselves out, with the positives edging out the negatives in the end. I hope Atlus takes it as a first step to diversify the SMT catalogue beyond the mainline and Persona games, because there are a lot of good elements in there that deserve to be explored further.

That said, I don't recommend this as your first outing as it'll give you a bad first impression on what to expect going forwards.\n\nThe good:\nThe setting and presentation are nice, lots of style to be had if you're a sci-fi nerd and need a change of pace from your average cyberpunk dystopia. (Not that the dystopian aspect isn't explored at all)\nCharacter design is stellar, especially for the important shop keepers you return to throughout the game.\nThe voice acting well done for the human characters and the jack frost monsters.\nAnd the story is by far the games best strong suit.\n\nThe bad:\nSimply put, this game overstays its welcome by a long shot.\n\nIf you're B lining it for the story you might not feel anything beyond the occasional grind wall for neglecting side content.\nHowever, being a completionist, or 80%ist, the game is littered with busy work that can feel more time wasting than interesting.\nby the 30 hour mark, you've already seen all there is aside from the stories conclusion.\nDungeons easily feel like stretches of land with nothing to do in them aside from fight, but you'll start to avoid combat after a while as the only time the game tests you is through the \"target\" series of side missions.\nThese missions start out fun, helping you come up with clever ways to beat the fight like a puzzle, but eventually feel like a gotcha for not investing in a monster who can use a particular skill. made worse by the fact, the hardest target missions, require abilities you don't \"need\" for anything in the base game.\nits not hard because you can't use your head, its hard because you happen to not have the answer with you, and you'll have to then spend the time to go bad and rebuild a particular monster to have the move.\nThe sad thing is, these will be the things that get you killed in almost every circumstance. the fights run on a timer where if you take too long, they'll throw out a move that insta kills the party. I can still count on two hands the amount of times I died to fights normally.\n\nOn the target of dungeons, the thing that finally got me to write them off, almost every late game dungeon relies on putting long hallways with rooms that have multiple teleporters everywhere. one or two, ok. but when five dungeons do the same thing back to back, thats not challenging. thats mind numming. made worse by the fact they all look the same.\n\nDemon negotiation is all but nonexistent in this. Now you just find you monsters throughout the dungeon, the demon will show up, ask for something slightly more demanding depending on how many of the said demon you've killed. they then join you no question.\n\nthe voices for the demons outside of the jack bros series aren't fitting either. recent game gave them good voices, but now suddenly ones who normally sound refined and calculated sound crazy and silly.\n\n\n\nwhat version should you get?\neither the deluxe or ultimate edition. get them on sale. don't pay full price for any version.\nthe inclusions either version provide make the overall game easier to swallow, especially with how low the price point has been getting on sales lately.\n\nFinal verdict: 6/10\nTLDR: its OK. but thats it. don't bother trying to 100% it.

Hate it for its technical failure. In other words: this is a fun game until it stops working. All I get upon starting the game now is eternal loading. Not recommended unless the issue gets fixed.\n\nTHE FULL REVIEW (spoiler-free)\n\n  Most of you have probably already got your info on this game from Megaten youtubers, so here I will mainly touch on things they didn't, or on points I have a different view on.\n\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nStory & Characters\n  You play as Ringo and three other party members to prevent the apocalypse in a futuristic and apparently stagnant but comfortable society. The plot has three major twists which I found engaging enough to keep me wanting to play. Ringo has a positive and playful personality, and I would love to befriend her IRL. Opinions on the other three party members vary across the playerbase, so make your own mind up. However, they still come across more alive in general than P3's cast (SEES); you can feel both the camaraderie and animosity in SH2. As for Figue, she is wife material; that is a fact!\n\nArt Style\n The game has a captivating art style and fresh character designs (within Megaten at least) and it pulls it off well.  The colours pop out very nicely in the whole game without being garish, whether it's on a bright environment like the hub worlds or sabbath attacks, or  the subtle specks of colour in the light signals and yellow lines in the dark subway tunnels. The menus are stylish but not overly so. I like the helpful skill type and weakness/resistance icons. Too bad the text is so small, and you cannot enlarge it in the config at all.\n\nMusic\n  Most tracks are just fine, but there are a few bangers. They are: Mansei Realm, Safehouse, Battle, Boss, Soul Matrix Boss, and the opening theme Hopeless Call. See also Soul Matrix section. \n\nCombat\n  The battles are easy in random encounters, but harder during the bosses from the mid-game onwards, and hardest during risky (mauve) enemies. The latter category is used to grind for high sums of XP and money. A good balance in difficulty overall. (I played on Normal all the way.)\n\nThe main principle in SH2 is the stack and sabbath system. Strike an enemy's weakness to add one of your demons to the stack. Once all your party members have their turn, all demons from the stack you made do a free, all-out attack on the enemy. The more demons in the stack, the more damage you do. This applies only to you; the enemy does not do stacks on you. \n\nAnother important change is that aliments are now a big deal, while are buffs and debuffs less so, so you should take ailment skills, vulnerabilities and resistances seriously when making your demons and constructing your party. Learn to exploit this to your advantage and you'll have such fun!  Shield spells (as well as buffs ad debuffs) work on all allies/enemies (so, you know: properly!) which is a definite plus. \nCritical hits, unfortunately, do not result in extra turns, unit later in the game as an optional, unlockable, in-game upgrade to your comp weapons. \n\nOverall the stack and Sabbaths make for a fun combat system. I like the build-up to each sabbath with the demon silhouettes and increasingly thick mist and colours. The sabbath attack animations are thrilling and satisfying to watch. I've only ever skipped them twice out of over 100 times.\n\nSoul Matrix\n  This is a semi-optional dungeon you must complete if you want to unlock more character abilities (summoner skills). Many players have complained that the Soul Matrix is the same visually and musically throughout, and while I absolutely see their point, it's not all bad. The music and atmosphere are very serene outside of battle, and I love to admire the shimmering effect on the floor or background blocks. I advise you to stop and smell the roses. Admittedly, the blocks and BG could at least have been differently coloured for each character, and maybe the hue could have changed the further you progress. Nevertheless, I'll still gladly take the Soul Matrix over Persona 3's Tartarus any day for the positives I've mentioned.\n\nDemon Personalities\n  Atlus have always tried to flesh out the demons' personalities through their dialogue in the Megaten games I am aware of, and SH2 builds on this trend. The demons in SH2 have text archetypes and voice archetypes to give you an idea of their personalities. Some of the voice archetypes which stood out to me are: the Valley Girl (Mermaid, Apsaras), the cocky and mischievous male (Gremlin, Andras, Cu Chulain), gay male (Mokoi, Mothman), caring older sister or governess (Silky, Valkyrie) and scumbag male (Pazuzu). They did interesting things with Mothman and Pazuz. Info on them below in their own sections.\n\nUnfortunately, these are for flavour only. The excellent demon loyalty mechanic from SH1 is gone. I'm not joking. Demon loyalty was fun in SH1 and half-arsed in the Raidou games.\n\nMothman (minor spoilers)\nA certain mothman stalks you throughout the apartment block dungeon to drain your party's MP before absconding to leave you fighting his increasingly tougher possy (nothing you shouldn't be able to handle by then). Mothman may use the gay voice archetype, but you know that one gets bitches. He is a real player. God bless you, Mothman! \nWhen you finally catch up to him, he has three of his fellows with him. Throughout the dungeon I kept thinking you would take him/them out in a boss battle similar to, but even more satisfying than, the cat in Eternal Punishment's TV studio dungeon, but no. They are destroyed for you in a cutscene. [sigh] Never mind.\n\nPazuzu\nAtlus has always been good at writing downright scummy characters when they intend to, and in SH2 this honour goes to Pazuzu. He is the objective in a semi-optional sidequest from Aion. His lines are voiced and let you know that although he is powerful and speaks in a refined manner, he is nothing more than a bully. If you have a shred of decency in you, you'll make it your obligation to take him out. Great job, writers. Another Pazuzu appears in the Ash boss fight and uses the poison mist mechanic which was fun.\n\nTHE BAD\n\nDemon negotiation\n  It is overly-simplified. It works, but it's better in Nocturne. Then again, did any Megaten veterans complain about buying demons in an auction in Devil Survivor?\n\nText Size\n  The text is much too small, and there is no way to change it. We went from nice and clear in P4G, to OK in Nocturne, to unreadable unless you put your spine into shrimp mode for the unvoiced dialogue in SH2. Please rectify this ASAP,  Atlus. I'm sure it would be much easier than sending Mr. Tomigawa round to fix my back every time.\n\nThe technical problem\n  All I get upon starting the game now is eternal loading. I can't even get the title screen anymore. And this was all of a sudden after playing the game some 135 hours. The solution someone suggested on the Steam forum did not work for me at all even after verifying all of my local files. I cannot even say to wait for a sale, because this may happen to you at any time. Whether you buy it cheap or dear, what good is a game you cannot keep playing?\n\nCONCLUSION\nWhat a shame. Apart form the one bug which makes the game unplayable, the good definitely outweighs the bad as long as you can play the game in the first place.", "timestamp_created": 1669553187, "timestamp_updated": 1669553187, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480906933546066284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127157179": {"recommendationid": "127157179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134475716", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1519, "last_played": 1669525839}, "language": "english", "review": "honestly pretty good game. story wasnt anything to crazy but i enjoyed it, characters i liked a lot and were very interesting, music was super good, gameplay was pretty much like every atlus game in a way and voice acting was really good", "timestamp_created": 1669526013, "timestamp_updated": 1669526013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50064849853515625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127139144": {"recommendationid": "127139144", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053292247", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 366, "last_played": 1669509358}, "language": "english", "review": "It's decent. \n7.5/10\n\nIts decent, but playing this right after Persona 5 hurts its score.\nPersona 5 had fast combat animations, great soundtracks, good pacing, and interesting maps.\nSoul Hackers 2 combat feels slower, soundtrack not memorable, a lot of side quests, and the 'soul' dungeons are all the same maze like style. \n\nPros:\nThe world is a futuristic japan with demons summoning being the normal.\nMain characters are fairly cool and their story unravels as you play.\nThe shops owners are like side characters with their own side quests and stories.\nSide quests are quite interesting for lore, world builder, and store owner stories. There are defeat or collect x amount of item requests, but you can usually do them alongside the main story/more interesting side quests.\nJapanese and English voice included. The japanese sounds more impactful to me, but you do miss out on battle dialogues not being shown as subtitles.\nThe sprites/artwork are nice and animated to talk and blink.\nThe camera work during cut scenes are quite nice and have more effort put into it. \n\nCon:\nCombat is not snappy and feels slow. There is a speed up option that doesn't feel nice to watch, but it does help.\nInitiating combat is odd. You need to swing at the enemies model and then walk up to it to start combat. I get its there so you can skip battles (swing but don't touch), but feels odd.\nMap list is ehh. Its gets long, and theres not indents to help quickly locate city or store options.\nWeird default settings. Like character purposely being off center, insanely zoom in camera, voice actors speaks before the text is able to appear. All can be fix in settings, but just weird choices to have as their default.\nDungeons gets boring quick. It just reused dungeons with long branches paths where you either hit a dead end or go the right path.\n\nOverall:\nIts a decent JRPG, don't recommend for full price.

I have a love/hate relationship with this game.\n\nI personally really adore Ringo as a character (She's a fully written, full voiced character which is awesome and hopefully ATLUS does this with future protagonists) and I really like Saizo, Milady, and Arrow too. I like the soundtrack with the opening theme being my favorite song from this game and it's cool that Keiichi Okabe composed the soundtrack. I found the world itself to be interesting, but not as much as the original Soul Hackers' world. I like how this game has a full adult cast and I super enjoyed their many interactions between one another! These characters are not friends and it took until almost the end of the game for your group in-game to truly \"be friends\" or at least get along well, and I know throughout the game they'll sometimes have a nice chat but a lot of the times when they're together they will have arguments of some kind (Arrow and Milady are a big example of this) and this is because they these four characters have no choice but to stick together and stay as a team to get through this even though they don't want to! They basically aren't friends and are forced to be together and overtime these characters develop more, and I honestly love all this about these characters. They're nothing like the usual characters who join you on your adventure in jrpg's and rpg's where everyone in your group is just super nice and wants to help you on your quest without question, with everything being hunky-dory. \n\nHowever, as for the things I do NOT like about this game: Let's start with the Soul Matrix. It feels pretty bland and uninteresting, the music is always the exact same which is a real shame. I don't like how no matter how deep the places goes the Soul Matrix always looks the exact same and it doesn't have any sort of variety to it. I also feel it drags on for far too long as what also doesn't help is the fact there's import story stuff tied to it and the player is required to completely explore the entirety of each Soul Matrix to unlock everything the Soul Matrix has to offer, including the story stuff. When I mentioned \"Each Soul Matrix\" I mean that there's three Sectors in the Soul Matrix. There's the Arrow Sector, Milady Sector, and the Saizo Sector, and each look and play the exact same but the only differences between them is that each sector has it'd own story stuff like cutscenes etc (for example, Saizo's Sector is focused on Saizo) and while I do love these three characters (ESPECIALLY Saizo) I honestly feel the Soul Matrix drags on for far too long and according to some players, the Soul Matrix became too much for them overtime and they didn't want to do them anymore which is a shame because of the story stuff that's locked behind the Soul Matrix is actually good important stuff for these characters from what I remember experiencing but I fully understand these players decision. I personally did not mind the Soul Matrix too much but yeah I honestly understand other people's  criticism. Another thing I don't like about this game are the many dungeons (and not to be confused with the Soul Matrix. that too is a dungeon but it's a single overly large dungeon with randomly generated layouts). These dungeons are more bearable than the Soul Matrix, HOWEVER these dungeons are very uninspired, uninteresting, and boring but sure you could say the dungeons of the original Soul Hackers were \"not good\" however I truly believe those dungeons had much more thought put into them plus all those dungeons in the original Soul Hacker's had great interactions within them, and I feel Soul Hackers 2 is absolutely brought down not only by it's dungeons but also how all interactions within those dungeons work. Something I should also mention about Soul Hackers 2's dungeons that I didn't enjoy is that it's dungeons lack puzzles or at least any good puzzles.\n\nOverall, I have a love/hate relationship for this game. There's things I wish had more thought put into (like the soul matrix, dungeons, and puzzles) and things that I believe are fine the way they are (like the main characters the player is with throughout this game, and the voice acting) and plus it's a good game in my opinion but there are things which hold it back from being great and the dungeons/soul matrix may turn away other people from playing this game, especially with how much talk there is about them online and to be honest the soul matrix is the worst part about this game for me.\n\nFor me this game is a 6-7/10 rating for me, at least! It has pros and it has cons, and because a lot of the time spent in this game is through the Soul Matrix and the many Dungeons explored in-game, It's a hard sell in my opinion. I feel this game is the perfect example as to why fun and overall great dungeon design in any game is super important and that bad uninspired dungeon design/dungeons is not good for any game.\n\nEven though my review says \"I recommended this game\" it's a review that's both positive and negative.", "timestamp_created": 1669499796, "timestamp_updated": 1669499796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505066037178039551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "127090216": {"recommendationid": "127090216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108626763", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5082, "last_played": 1669492245}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has a very good story, par for the course for ATLUS.

That's disappointing to write, but I did have higher expectations for this game. However, as a non mainline game, Soul Hackers 2 kept my interest enough while Persona 5 got released on PC. I wouldn't play it a second time now that Persona 5 is out, but I'm glad I finished it. It was lacking in story, yet it it did have interesting characters, Saizo being my favorite of course. It also had demons and gameplay that you'll easily get familiar with if you ever played any Shin Megami Tensei or Persona game. I definitely wished it was more developed regarding the dungeons, which are repetitive and aesthetically boring, and customization, which just boils down to using the highest stat item and paying for the DLC if you want your characters to look different.  All of that said, the game is addicting for someone like me who loves playing Shin Megami Tensei and Persona games. I love grinding, listening to the music, and seeing the visuals and the interesting characters. It maybe needed more time of development to make it feel more unique, but as it is, I still recommend the game if you never played any of the other Atlus games I mentioned.

It shines brighting when it comes to their characters, if you do most of the sidequest and their little hangouts events you are really gonna be missing the main cast by the time de credits role.

The OST tends to be the highlight of other entries but in this it left a lot to be desired (good thing is you can play other games' battle music if you bought the costume DLCs).

The series is now a persona spinoff complete with lack of demon party members and recruitment. Instead you equip one of your four human party members with a demon and they use the inherited spells and abilities. Recruitment is handled in the most brain dead way possible, you walk around and find them randomly. You simply give them what they ask for and if your level is high enough they're yours. You'll be hunting for demons randomly placed in dungeon maps so boring and empty you'll get persona 3/4 flashbacks and they aren't even randomly generated maps! Combat is one of the worst in the series thus far! Instead of the one more time system where a strike with an enemies weakness you get build your \"Sabbath\" charge. Some hits can add more than 1 per attack if you hit hard enough or use a commander skill to boost them. At the end of your turn your demons come out to smack the enemy. You or your enemies hitting weaknesses do not give/take away turns unless it's status related which makes the combat extremely easy and boring. In an attempt rectify this they added the commander skills from SMT strange journey REDUX [spoiler] it didn't help, combat is still boring [/spoiler].

By downing enemies using their weakness or getting a critical hit, it adds to the sabbath counter, in which more and more demons can participate and deal extra damage, as well as some having sabbath skills that allow for extra moves being able to be pulled off (extra damage, health/mp restore, etc).\nThe characters are also, well, full of character! They do fall a bit cliche at times, but Arrow and Milidy's constant bickering, with Saizo just in the backround trying to stay neutral was pretty amusing, and Ringo's initial snarkiness at how primative humanity is was always fun. In fact, Ringo in general is just a fun character who calls everyone out on their BS.\nHonestly, the only thing i can really say the game was lacking in were the dungeons. I wasnt expecting Persona 5 levels of design, but the long corridors lead me to think that the dungeons were originally going to be randomly generated (ala persona 3/4), especially the SOUL Matrix, the \"mementos\" as it were of the game. Other than bland dungeon design though, the game might be a tad on the shorter side (no side content start to finish being about 6-7 hours, doing only the manditory 1st floor of the matrix and minimal demon fusion), but on a \"normal\" playthrough, its probably going to take around 9-10 hours, especially when counting in the DLC.\nOverall, i give the game a 7.5/10\nIts fun and enjoyable, but not for everyone. the game had a small budget and it shows, but it does everything it can with that budget.\n$60 is totally worth it, but hey, it doesnt hurt your wallet to see if it goes on sale for ~$40.", "timestamp_created": 1668257656, "timestamp_updated": 1668257656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481247454881668091", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "125261111": {"recommendationid": "125261111", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999435655", "num_games_owned": 914, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2653, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2653, "last_played": 1667333626}, "language": "english", "review": "     So first off, let me state that Soul Hackers 2 IS NOT PERSONA in any way shape, or form! If you need to have this game compared to something from Atlus, the closest match is Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore for the Nintendo Switch. They are very similar in design philosophy, battles, etc. \nSo now that is out of the way. Let's get to the pros and cons!\n\nPros-\n- Future Cyberpunk setting (think Cyberpunk Edgerunner aesthetic mixed with SAO anime character design)\n- The cast of characters (the cast is small but has enough variety and personality differences. Character growth also happens as you do more side quests and activities with them, as well as advance the main story.)\n- Combat is fun with a twist to the usual Atlus-style combat systems that we have come to expect from things like Persona. \n- No knowledge of the previous game is needed at all.\n- Music and Voice acting are all good and fit the setting and themes.\n\nCons-\n\n- Combat-heavy game (If you are more for story over gameplay this game may not be for you as there is a TON of dungeon crawling and combat with a little section of the main story thrown in at various points.)\n- Difficulty Spikes (certain areas can see a sharp increase in difficulty.)\n- Side quests (Kill X many things, Fetch this, there are some story bits that try to make them at least entertaining. However, the biggest problem is all the backtracking to previous areas to complete these quests.) \n\n     So is Soul Hackers 2 the next big Persona franchise Atlus is hoping it would be? Nah, it is more the Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE Encore just available on every platform now. It is a decent game as long as you do not come in expecting Persona 5 Royal, or Persona 4 Golden.

My favorite game of all time is the first Persona. I was really disappointed with the direction the series went with social links in 3 on. I mention this in case just knowing that helps you decide if you agree with me or not going forward.\n\nAs far as Soul Hackers go, and the first Devil Summoner...I dabbled with them, but didn't get far because of the language barrier (back when they were on Saturn). They both became more of collectors items. So I can't really compare this game to the first...but what this game came out to was pretty impressive.\n\nThe combat system feels pretty standard of the series, but I really like the benefit of stacks from hitting weaknesses. I am always targeting weaknesses and keeping a balance of spells, so this is just adding icing on the damage cake.\n\nAlso the way social links are handled in this is so much better than the other SMT games i have played. It doesn't feel like it is trying to take over like in the Persona series. Its subtle...leaving the game, exploration, and combat as the main focus.\n\nI've seen others mention areas being boring and bland...and that there are a lot of cut scenes, making it more of a visual than a game. I haven't gotten super far into it (around level 22 currently), but I haven't felt like I have been spending more time watching than playing...and the areas do look the same, but it didn't seem like a distraction or disappointment to me. I grew up on areas looking the same. Thankfully there is an on screen map to help. I remember the days of NES exploration where that wasn't present.\n\nI guess if I could sum this up is that this probably won't be the best game you have ever played....or even the best game in the \"SMT blanket series\". But it doesn't leave a bad taste. It is enjoyable...it might not be the most amazingly detailed game ever, but neither is my favorite game of all time. \n\nPersona is over 25 years old and I will still play it today.

I loved the characters, thought the camera work and animation were wonderful (on top of the fact that, according to what I've seen, this is the first game where ATLUS ACTUALLY ANIMATED ENGLISH LIP SYNCING, HELL FREAKING YES), enjoyed the combat (though some of it needs work, namely enemy balance and the amount of grinding you need to to), and the story was nice and had plenty of good writing in it.\nHOWEVER\nIt is far from glorious. Some of the dungeons (especially in the endgame) are horribly designed and made me legit look up a guide just to navigate through them, which for basic map design with zero puzzles should not happen. The game forces you to grind a lot, which is thankfully easier to do with the character Axes areas, but it's still a drag. And I played this game before they released the QoL update, which took over TWO MONTHS to come out and adds damn near necessities for a JRPG, like a freaking RUN BUTTON.\nIt's not perfect, no game is. It has its flaws, major and minor. But the people who say it's the worst thing ever are very much exaggerating it. I enjoyed the game as a fresh, new experience, using the demons I loved from SMT and the gameplay design of ATLUS I've known for years. I think it could've been great, but some of the decisions they made regarding endgame stuff and the flow not really having a hook to it (I lost motivation to play this game 4 times over the course of 2 months, most good games I finish I only lose motivation to do so one time, if at all) shot the game down in the end.

What people care about is a good JRPG with great dungeons and even greater story. Sadly this ain't it chief. Soul hackers 2 is plagued by a predictable story, boring lazy dungeons that frankly just waste your time, static characters, and Cash grab DLC. The only saving grace of this game is the amazing characters designs and well built world, But you don't really get to explore the world so it doesn't matter. This game is pure cash grab that felt like there was some sense of passion earlier but quickly muddled by the need for money. If you had high hopes for this game like me, or was hoping for another amazing JRPG by Atlus, boy are you ready to be absolutely disappointed. So lets break open this baby.\n\nDungeons and Gameplay\nThe dungeons in this game are literally walking simulators with enemy encounters. If you thought death stranding was a boring walking sim, this is worse. Dungeons all look the same, either some sort of subway or the matrix. There is only 1 dungeon that's even some what appealing to look at and its the final dungeon. To be honest these dungeons are worse than P4. Large areas with loops and turns that take forever to get through and ringo walks like a slow ass grandma, yeah i fell asleep while exploring the dungeons. Puzzle don't seem to exist in the world of soul hackers because every dungeon is the same walking sim bull shit. What's worse is there's a section of a dungeon that becomes random encounters while not being able to see shit because camera controls are limited. enough is enough and i've said enough about these horrible dungeons, Battles and encounters on the other hand aren't that bad. It's your typical smt/persona TB battle system. Target weaknesses apply debuffs and buffs. The sabbath system, while a bit simple is really fun. Finding demons with unique sabbath only abilities is always fun. Commander skills feel a bit overpowered at times but being OP is fun. Difficulty doesn't really exist in this game. It's overall a very easy game with some systems that let you feel OP. The one Negative about battles is probably ruin. instead of having abilities that do specific debuffs, ruin abilities do damage while applying debuffs. Ruin kinda breaks the balancing of all area's excluding bosses(Bosses are usually resistant to ruin all together). So gameplay is fun.\n\nStory and Characters\nsince this is spoiler free i'm just gonna keep this section short. The story is predictable, BUT NOT BORING just predictable. Some aspects of the story don't make sense and character development is weak. some characters are ruined by events in the game and i don't like it. Saizo is the only saving grace of this game. The character I thought i'd absolutely hate is the most dynamic character. Most of the characters in this game are fairly static till the the last few hours of the game, and the ending feels rushed. Overall its a mediocre story about human emotion and the characters are fairly static till the last hour. Also the ending feels rushed and pacing is all over the place, like all JRPG's.\n\nConclusion\nI don't have to tell you that the world of this game is amazing. I don't have to tell you that the character designs are amazing. That's probably why you're here. The overall game isn't that great. The dungeons are just walking sims with rpg battles, and the story is a weak one with static characters.

Doing their side content (hangouts and soul matrix) even gives extra information and background about the antagonists which makes them feel more like characters than typical big bads.\n\n[*] Combat. Didn't know if I liked sabbaths over press turns or one more system at first but honestly it feels really nice and unique. The progression in strength is very apparent and satisfying though a bit slow\n\n[*] Boss fights are great. They felt really weird at first but once they clicked they were pretty fun and creative\n\n[*] OST, there aren't many as far as I've found but whatever OST the game does have is great. I remember almost every track in the game and they live in my head rent free. A real shame that there weren't more tracks though.\n\n[*] Aesthetics. Honestly, Atlus has been killing it in the aesthetic game ever since Persona 5, and this games no exception.  Everything exudes charm and looks extremely nice and polished. \n\n[*] Story is nice, I honestly never felt bored of the story so far (I'm currently just after Ozaki Hope Tower). Lots of character moments and growth alongside twists that I personally didn't see coming. The game tries to be darker in tone while also being somewhat lighthearted. It knows when to joke and when to be serious, though it doesn't go too far into the darker tones. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Meh[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Demon recon is alright, nothing bad but doesn't do well in trying to replace demon negotiations. They needed smth better to actually replace it and sadly recon falls kinda short.  Otherwise, the mechanic is honestly just glorified chests. I feel like a lot of people hate on it a bit too much considering what they actually are\n\n[*] Dungeons are alright. I personally don't mind them, after so many gimmicks in tons of dungeons in other SMT/Persona games it's nice to just have straightforward dungeons. Dungeons still do have some gimmicks, usually enough to mix it up but not enough to get too annoying (except for the tp puzzles in fucking soul matrix 3F). Honestly didn't feel like it was as bad or even worse than smth like Tartarus from P3 but the lack of varied OST doesn't help the dungeons. They also feel way too large, especially with the lack of proper sprinting before the QoL update. The quality is passable till near the very end when you have to deal with Soul Matrix 4F and the Sea level, those specific dungeons are just badly designed\n[/list]\n\n[b]Bad[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Mechanics are introduced way too late, some of these will be nulled by the patch coming in Nov but since I mostly played in the launch version I feel the need to mention them\n\n[list]\n[*] Assassin's step (a speed boost that lasts a short distance) is only gotten like maybe 7 to 10 hours in if you're lucky and know where to get it. This makes a lot of dungeons drag on for way too long until you get this skill. Even after getting it some dungeons can drag on for way too long. Once dedicated free sprinting arrives in the upcoming patch, this will become a non-issue but since it'll be a few weeks to a month till then as of writing the review this is a huge issue.\n\n[*] Active commander skills, mainly conversion. Without it the combat feels very annoying as you can't change demons mid combat without it yet won't get it till at least 3 or 4 hours into the game. It would feel much better if it was introduced earlier alongside the COMP smith or when the first soul matrix is introduced but not enough to make the game too annoying early on.\n[/list]\n\n[*] Soul matrix dungeons are WAY too long, especially early on. IMO the soul matrix dungeons should be quick in and out sections that allows you to power up without making u stray from the main game for too long, but sadly the soul matrix takes maybe 30 minutes to an hour AFTER you gain the ability to run but before that they can last for more than an hour which I feel is way too long\n\n[*] The game seems to be a bit too obsessed with Almighty boss signature moves. Which isn't really bad... it just feels very annoying at times when you're fighting a boss and they pull out their almighty attack and you can't do nothing bout it but lose a character or take massive damage based on your luck and stats.\n\n[*] For some reason if you show beginner tips in the load screens the game takes much longer to load even if you're on an NVMe so if you want faster load times turn those off and you load way faster!\n\n[*] Game is really short for its price and considering the fact that this game has no regional pricing like most Atlus titles it hampers the enjoyment for people like me who could get maybe 3-4 decent games at the same price\n[/list]\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nOverall, aside from the trash day 1 DLC that Atlus pushed out, the game itself isn't bad. The game is just... different. I was one of the people who pretty much knew as soon as the trailer dropped that this ain't gonna be Soul Hackers part 2, or SMT or even Persona. It really felt like they were trying to be different but chose an existing name to use for some reason when it barely connects. If you ignore the fact this game is called \"Soul Hackers 2\" there's a lot that can be enjoyed here, but... \n\n[h1]While I'm giving a recommend on this game I highly suggest waiting for the upcoming patch before getting this game and wait for a sale[/h1]\n\nOverall the game is a solid 8/10. It's not lifechanging but is much better than all the doomsayers that gave the game a 55% mixed rating on Steam. The game feels very persona 2-esque with characters developing with or without the interference of the main character and everyone's ability to use any demons with some caveats so if you enjoyed Persona 2 specifically then this game may be right up your alley.\n\nI wouldn't say that the game feels rushed, it just has some weird design flaws that are thankfully going to be fixed with the upcoming patch. Overall, while I agree that the game has flaws in many aspects: dungeon design, QoL and the shitty day one DLC, the game still does tons of good despite all this. Hopefully a lot of the negativity dies down once they release the QoL patch (expecting them to make the DLC be free/cheaper is pretty unrealistic but will also help a lot).", "timestamp_created": 1666054501, "timestamp_updated": 1668236003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725190281867980957", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123974307": {"recommendationid": "123974307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034252859", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 450, "last_played": 1666017311}, "language": "english", "review": "Unfortunately I can't recommend this.

The characters are compelling, the Japanese voice acting is superb, the localization has done a fine job with the challenges faced by translators. The art work and style are excellent, consistent, and well-used in conveying the tricky bits involved in AI personalities interacting with Human Beings.\n\nAny experience you've had with all those previous games in the SMT/P series carries over well into finding your way around this piece of world building. And yet, remarkably, it feels fresh. Well done, authors, artists, and Atlus! My own time with SMT goes back to the PS Vita and Nintendo products of that era. I'm thoroughly enjoying this game! \n\nOne thing I've noticed with this particular battle system; in many turn-based team battle settings it often feels optimal for your team members to gang up on opposing targets, eliminating them one by one - for each one quickly eliminated, that's one less source of incoming fire.\n\nNot so here! Instead, it seems to be preferable to spread the damage across as many in the enemy group as possible, to bring their HP count down across the board, so that when Ringo lets go with a Stack Attack you can wipe out multiple targets in one swipe. Very interesting. Battles in Soul Hackers 2 take on a completely different dynamic from a lot of other turn-based battle system games. It feels fresh and interesting.\n\nNow, there are technical aspects to the Denuvo Digital Rights Management (DRM) solution that some folks object to as a matter, to them, of principle. Perhaps they feel they should have the right to copy and redistribute software freely, despite that specifically being prohibited by the Terms of Use they've agreed to by installing and starting the software. What we purchase is not the software, but the limited and specific rights to use it, under license. Copyright laws vary by nation but are established with consistent intent to protect the rights of authors and publishers of creative works. Those rights are not cancelled simply because someone doesn't agree with them, any more than your right to speak would be cancelled if I didn't agree with you.\n\nLike the game? Want to try the game? Buy the game. if you're offended by the DRM implementation, then return the game under Valve's Terms of Use and get your refund. But please don't tear down or trash-talk a game or a game publisher simply because they've taken steps to protect their rights to a creative work.\n\nDoes this trash-talking happen to every game that employs Denuvo DRM? If so, that's an injustice against the authors and artists. And while we're at it, the level of piracy in the present world is a plague upon any creative house trying to produce and publish copyrighted work in a sustainable way. Want less noxious DRM? Stop downloading copyrighted works from piracy sites.\n\nAnd none of this has any bearing on the merits of this work as a game. I've been enjoying it very much, and feel anyone who's enjoyed previous excursions into this universe will probably enjoy this one as well!\n\nSo thanks again, authors, artists, composers, musicians, and publishers! My life is enriched by your creative efforts, and I'm glad to support them!\n\nAddin, now at  65 game-hours,,,\nStill a strong recommend for this one! I'm actually playing it in parallel with Persona 4, 5, and Soul Hackers 1 on the 3DS. It's turning into quite the late Autumn/early Winter binge here, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it!\n\nSome folks say the Soul Matrix levels are tedious, or overly plain: Bah! Look at them on a decent monitor, they're a nice rendering of the idea of a synthetic reality - and their design from a game architecture standpoint is just fine. The stairs come along when they need to, the gates are well-placed, the story-reveals are meaningful and significant, if you just let the story do its thing on you; there's really no problem here.\n\nSo in sum, at this stage, this is a game that belongs in the SMT Universe. \n\nThere's room in the world for Golf, Croquet, and Frisbee Golf, too!", "timestamp_created": 1665541726, "timestamp_updated": 1667688233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479162693023681641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123704020": {"recommendationid": "123704020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198375474114", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1665539704}, "language": "english", "review": "The Third Area you unlock has a Breaking Bad Reference", "timestamp_created": 1665537001, "timestamp_updated": 1665537001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123688895": {"recommendationid": "123688895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198870881046", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1131, "last_played": 1673079194}, "language": "english", "review": "if i didn't know i was bi before i definitely would've realised now", "timestamp_created": 1665508429, "timestamp_updated": 1665508429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480562806129455566", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123668637": {"recommendationid": "123668637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104213720", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3793, "last_played": 1665467688}, "language": "english", "review": "this game taught me that u shouldn't always trust mixed reviews on steam, it's absolutely fine and i enjoyed my time playing it.\n\nlol at the guy who spent 2 full playthroughs and 100+ hours just to write a novel on how much he hated the game. if you don't like the game the first time, what is the point of playing it a second time ?!?!?!?!!? \u30fd(\u2035\ufe4f\u00b4)\u30ce\n", "timestamp_created": 1665468520, "timestamp_updated": 1665468520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 158, "votes_funny": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680186808109283447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123664737": {"recommendationid": "123664737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189902861", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3345, "last_played": 1665636124}, "language": "english", "review": "Another SMT game, if you like persona-likes then you'll like this game", "timestamp_created": 1665458113, "timestamp_updated": 1665458113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523894369602203369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123664707": {"recommendationid": "123664707", "author": {"steamid": "76561199091910003", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 962, "last_played": 1671331545}, "language": "english", "review": ".", "timestamp_created": 1665458035, "timestamp_updated": 1665458035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491183876991271973", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123655037": {"recommendationid": "123655037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042462963", "num_games_owned": 1049, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 511, "last_played": 1662015074}, "language": "english", "review": "As painful as it is to say it, this is not a good megaten game.

It's a surprisingly good sequel to Soul Hackers 1 too, which is one of my favorite RPGs. I wasn't sure what to expect at first, as the preview trailers didn't remind me much of the first game and the game wasn't a first person DRPG like the original. They actually nailed the tone and atmosphere pretty well somehow though, and there are a lot of similarities to the first game that really solidify it as a proper sequel.\n\nI enjoyed the game, but depending on your expectations you might not enjoy it as much.\n[list]\n[*] Ringo is an amazing protagonist. She provides the same sassy attitude that Nemissa did in the first game. I hope future Megaten games have voiced protagonists because it worked really well here.\n[*] Unlike a lot of recent SMT games, the combat doesn't use the press turn system. I found the change refreshing, but I can understand why some players were disappointed. The systems here are pretty fun but notably less punishing than press turn combat.\n[*] Hard difficulty felt like it should've been called normal difficulty for most of the game. Towards the end it felt perfectly balanced, though. I'd recommend playing on Hard if you've completed any other game in this franchise.\n[*] The pace of the story is fairly slow. I enjoyed this, actually.\n[*] The pace of the gameplay can feel tedious by modern standards. Battle animations, movement speed etc. start to feel too slow after a while. It's on par with what you'd find in some PS2 games. I wasn't bothered by this much until Soul Matrix 4F took me way too long. Atlus has announced an upcoming patch to address these issues.\n[*] The soundtrack is really nice, subdued but catchy and very reminiscent of the first game.\n[*] Performance is very good with very high framerates. Unfortunately you'll want to cap at 60 FPS because Ringo's movement goes too wonky at anything higher.\n[*] Visually, the game is a mixed bag. Some areas feel unnaturally vacant and clearly didn't get enough attention. One of the mid-game dungeons looks straight out of a PS Vita game. The 2D assets all look great.\n[*] The dungeon the DLC questline concludes in is a bit of a joke (not sure if the dungeon itself is DLC). Despite using unique assets, the entire dungeon is the same room repeated about 20 times.\n[*] Linux/Steam Deck support isn't there currently. The game runs well on my Linux desktop but missing some visual effects. Steam Deck has more severe issues with audio playback.\n[/list]\n\nThe current mixed rating is pretty harsh, but not entirely undeserved. The DLC situation is pretty inexcusable and I hope Atlus isn't quite so brazen next time. \n\nThe game itself is pretty solid, despite the lack of polish in some areas. I think it's a great sequel, all things considered. Most of the issues/shortcomings can be chalked up to the development team working with an unfamiliar engine, and maybe some unrealistic player expectations.

Not for kids unless they are older and pretty jaded. Gameplay is Persona and SMT style and very enjoyable. Some of the DLC is good, but it is not must buy and with the exception of the cosmetics, can be attained in game. \n\n[b][u]Rating[/u][/b]\nThe game is rated Mature for violence, partial nudity, strong language, and blood and gore. The violence is characters laying in pools of blood, a character getting impaled through the chest, and a dismembered body part. There are scenes with on of the main characters with no clothing covered with a sheet, and scantily clad female demons. One of the demons is a phallic H.R. Geiger-esque monster. They drop the F-bomb and other words in the game as well. Lastly you do summon and contract demons in the game. They are based on all of the current and past mythologies of the world. \n\n[b][u]Controls: [/u][/b]\nIn towns and dungeons you have the freedom to run around and interact like most modern JRPGs, and inn dungeons you have a diablo-esque overlay map. Random encounters pop up on the map, and you can \"slice\" them to avoid the encounter, which is a feature that is very nice. There are also checkpoints, or gates, in the dungeon that allow fast travel to various points in the dungeon. The battle menu has the Persona feel, meaning every action is linked to a button rather than choosing from a menu. The enemies (and you) have resistances and weaknesses that you can exploit to do massive damage, and add stacks for an end of round attack called a \"Sabbath\" that attacks with the demons the character that exploited the weakness summoned and does pretty good damage to all enemies. \n\n[b][u]DLC:[/u][/b]\nLet's begin with saying that the DLC is absolutely not necessary. In fact, I daresay play the game through without it and then get the DLC. I willl break down the DLCs and what they add to the game: \n\n[b]Boost Item Pack:[/b] This gives you the ability to turn on items that boost your stats and abilities in the game. After you turn them on in the gameplay menu, you get items that sell at a high price to the vendors, Items that allow you to buy stat raising items from a vendor, and items that each one boosts you a level and ove that boosts your demons a level. You get one of each of these items after you defeat an enemy in combat. \n\n[b]Bonus Story Arc[/b] This gives you access to a new [b]non-playable[/b] summoner, and an extra dungeon and an extremely difficult boss fight. The Story is pretty good, and the dungeon is enjoyable, and the boss fight will rock your world. Definitely wait until you have mastered the game for this one. \n\n[b]Demon Pack[/b] This will add 8 [i]powerful[/i] demons to the compendium, once you unlock it. You will be able to summon them for free the first time, and they are stupidly powerful. This and the boost item pack has the potential to make the game too easy on normal difficulty, unless you fight a risky enemy. \n\n[b]Costume and BGM pack[/b] adds costumes from Persona 4 and 5, SMT4, Soul Hackers 1, Devil Summoner, and swimsuits. It also adds a BGM that you can change in the menu. Get it if you are into that kind of thing, but this one is definitely skippable. \n\n[b]Useful Item Set & Extra Difficulty:[/b] This one give you 2 of a few items that will help out in the beginning of the game, most notably original flames  which will prevent a wipe on normal difficulty. This is assuredly not a must have, and the extra difficulty is only if you want a challenge beyond hard. The bonus is that as of the time of this review, it is free. \n\n[b]Final thoughts:[/b] I have thoroughly enjoyed this game and will wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. I love the controls and the battle system, though the dungeons can be a little grindy. the ability to avoid battles and the gate system mitigates that a bit. I think this is a great addition to the SMT universe.", "timestamp_created": 1665341735, "timestamp_updated": 1674798430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515418469905853271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123573082": {"recommendationid": "123573082", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149460098", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1062, "last_played": 1669044533}, "language": "english", "review": "I am so in love with Ringo it's not even funny anymore, my favorite game of the year 100%\n\n\n\n\n\nshe has ruined my life", "timestamp_created": 1665297431, "timestamp_updated": 1665297431, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.366930454969406128", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123571711": {"recommendationid": "123571711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037567013", "num_games_owned": 541, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 210, "last_played": 1666271413}, "language": "english", "review": "Its fun gathering demons. combat is not too stressful", "timestamp_created": 1665294287, "timestamp_updated": 1665294287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463709652423858643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123571568": {"recommendationid": "123571568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084462439", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2515, "last_played": 1663040559}, "language": "english", "review": "Its just like those Atlus PS2 games pretty much, so like 7 or 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1665293985, "timestamp_updated": 1665293985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430988669395446777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123567650": {"recommendationid": "123567650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020814096", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3233, "last_played": 1664940589}, "language": "english", "review": "Story and characters are solid, OST is hit or miss, and the dungeon design is forgettable at best and bad at worst.

While the game is good in some aspects, it's tainted by some very glaring cons that make it a drag to play at points. It's hard to give it a positive rating, so I'm going to say I'm very mixed. Here's why: \n\nThe game itself visually looks well with the vibrant color palette and character designs, especially Ringo and Figue who serve as the main character and sidekick, who look very well done with the cyberpunk-ish look and style.\n\nThis game's cast, which is an adult cast this time around instead of younger teenagers like the Persona series, is a good bunch with their own distinct backgrounds, personalities, motives, etc. Each character is perfectly fine, and I had no complaints on how they handled them. It's not one I would vaguely remember many years from now, but they were an interesting bunch. The main character Ringo, she is easily the best part of this game. They actually went with a protagonist who isn't silent this time around, and I hope it's not the last time due to this games' mixed reception. She was very like-able from the beginning, and is easily the best character by a landslide.\n\nThe story itself was alright as well, with the different side characters this game offers and events. The antagonists were very bland though IMO and weren't nothing to write home about. I will throw in a big con about the story however here. The biggest gut punch about party's backstories (Arrow, Milady & Saizo) if you want to learn them, you have to go through the 'Soul Matrix', which is the most bland and uninspired dungeon I have probably ever witnessed in an JRPG. More on this later on exploration. \n\nNow time for the points I am either mixed on, or very much despise about the game: \n\nThe combat itself at first is okay, the sabbath system is essentially the \"All-Out Attacks\" from the Persona series, except some demons can acquire skills called \"sabbath skills\", that usually tack on extra damage or ailments to the enemy. The skill variety is what you can expect from an SMT game, but certain demons have their own unique skills that are just not in the game at all. The biggest one being Yoshitsune, who's unique skill is 'Hassou Tobi' which is a big part of why he is a sought after demon to recruit/fuse, is just not there. This was a slap in the face when I realized this, and is very jarring since we just got SMT V less than a year ago and these skills including that one are all there in that game? The combat after a while becomes a cake walk, especially since it isn't the press turn system and you can hit enemies that resist/null certain affinities and not get penalized for it. The COMP skills however, I can say I thought was a good addition and made it a bit more interesting and made you want to go after since they can increase damage and affinities which are huge to have for later. \n\nThe OST is nothing too special, certainly not even close to touching Shoji Meguro or Ryota Kozuka works by any means, but it was fine. They let MONACA, who have made the music for the Nier series, handle the soundtrack instead and while there are some tracks that are good, they aren't any that would stand out that I would listen to over time after playing. The best piece I would say is the game's main theme \"Hopeless Call\". I wouldn't say there are any BAD battle themes, they are all decent but not too memorable like mentioned. \n\nNow finally for the exploration / dungeon layout - which is BY FAR the WORST part of this game. The dungeons are very linear and get to be a drag to get through, especially since there isn't a dedicated DASH BUTTON. A bit later on, you start to acquire these skills called \"Map Skills\", which can make these more bearable but still a chore since you spend a bit of MP to activate them and have to constantly refresh them. One of these skills is \"Assassin's Footsteps\" I believe it's called which served as this game's run button for dungeons / open areas, which runs out after a short while and costs 10 MP each time to use. Why would this be locked behind a skill for crying out loud? Persona 5 had a dash button for dungeons and that game came out years before this. At the time of me typing this, they announced on October 3rd 2022 they are releasing a patch for the game that adds a dash button and other fixes that will be released sometime in November I believe. I can respect them for at least going back to correct it, but it's too late for many who have already played it and moved on, myself included. \n\nThe demon negotiating, which is a big staple of the franchise, has been completely watered down here. Within dungeons you send out the demons in your current stock to \"recon\" the area, which they usually turn up with an item either for restorative purposes or for a quest, or just straight up restore your HP/MP. It's completely randomized, and these recon demons are also how you recruit new demons to your party. Again, it's COMPLETELY randomized which demon it selects, but it usually is according to the current dungeon difficulty/level. The thing is, instead of the demon asking you questions unique to itself, as well as asking for either Macca or items, it only asks for either ONE item or Macca and it joins you simple as that. Recruiting this way that's completely randomized as well as brain dead frankly was very uninteresting. \n\nContinuing from my last point about dungeon layouts... The 'Soul Matrix' I mentioned earlier, which is required to go through for the main story to an extent, but further if you want to learn more about the party members, is the main culprit with awfully linear and repetitive these dungeons can be. Each floor for each character looks the EXACT SAME, but are laid out differently and end up getting more complex with random warps and such as you progress further up. These are so bad that I started to believe they were auto generated with how straight forward and boring these got. This itself is the biggest con of the game for myself and many others I can see. \n\nAnd to wrap it up, this game brings back more \"Day 1 DLC\", similar to the sort SMT V had, but it is infinitely worse here. The biggest part of being an ENTIRE SEPARATE STORY ARC locked behind it. The game itself it pretty short for an SMT title, so why would they cut this out and not leave it in to add some more depth and side quests, when the side quests in this game for the most part are just fetching something and skipping dialogue just to get to the reward? The DLC also includes bonus demons as well, including Satan and Mara. The other two are costume packs and booster items, which are okay and should've been the only two. The costume packs are different outfits for the party you will recognize from older Megaten titles, and include some unique music tracks depending on which you wear. You cannot see these costumes outside of battle however. I own the DLC, which I regret greatly after playing. I went and spent my time getting all the achievements the game has to offer to get my moneys worth at least. \n\nIf you are interested in buying the game as a Megaten series fan, or even just a fan of JRPGs, please wait until this game is discounted to AT LEAST half off. Looks like it's currently at $45 USD at the time of my review, and the highest tier, the \"Digital Premium\" edition listed at $58.49 instead of $90 USD retail.

There are few hubs and shops to visit, bunch of meaningless sidequests, and if you dont buy the premium edition of the game you dont even get DLC sidequest story, which is atleast better than the rest of them, still it was a dumb idea to lock the quest behind a paywall.\n\nNext is music - there is literally nothing outstanding, they even give persona 5 tracks to listen in game if you want to but just battle theme i think.Few zones have different themes, but nothing memorable. Every battle has the same music, every boss has generic boss music, except maybe few, like the last boss.\n\nThe worst issue is the maps of the game. Holy mother of god they are bad, especially later on in the game and if you're doing side stuff good luck traversing hundreds of empty rooms,alleys,platform,teleports,puzzles which is the most infuriating part of this game its empty, soulless not considering the game is mega short if you arent doing any side content whatsoever.\n\nThey literally took the worst parts of previous SMT/Persona games and made this instead (Like tartarus/mementos etc) but this on steroids. Random encounters everywhere, thus they can be avoided, annoying voice telling every 2sec that \"you were spotted\" and \"now you can relax\" \n\nIf you wanna pick this up, just wait for sale like 80% or something like that, because at this point this not even worth 30eur\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1665049787, "timestamp_updated": 1665049787, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659253597259521484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123428839": {"recommendationid": "123428839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198825185580", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 802, "last_played": 1661829920}, "language": "english", "review": "eh", "timestamp_created": 1665043974, "timestamp_updated": 1665043974, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.409862637519836426", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123426562": {"recommendationid": "123426562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284906481", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 136, "playtime_forever": 4866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4866, "last_played": 1665299268}, "language": "english", "review": "Soul Hackers 2 is a pretty good entry into the ever expanding library of the SMT series. It'd definitely following the trend of becoming more \"Persona\" than previous SMT games, but still manages to deliver a worthwhile experience.\n\nFirst off, and the biggest draw of the game to me, the characters. Most of the time, SMT doesn't really focus on its cast, they serve their purpose, and have their quirks to them, but generally, SMT is about the gameplay. Soul Hackers 2 is not like that. While the non-essential story characters are incredibly flat and forgettable, the core party and those close to them are incredibly memorable and fun to watch. The chemistry between Ringo, Arrow, Milady, and Saizo works really well, and every scene they're in is a joy to watch. The story is more interesting than your standard apocalypse scenario because of how well the characters are all written, and it makes you feel for everyone on all sides. It's hard to make all of your characters likeable like this, and you can tell a lot of effort went into making the cast a lot more three dimensional than your standard SMT cast. \n\nHowever, the writing only gets you so far in an RPG like this, hows the gameplay? Well, its definitely a lot more simple than most other Atlus RPGs, this isn't too terrible, and allows the game to be a lot more accessible to new players, but if you're a hardcore SMT gatekeeper, you'll likely be disappointed. The move pool is drastically smaller than even Persona's, and demon move slots are limited to 6. Fusion is super streamlined, similarly to SMT V, with compendium fusions being carried over, reducing the tedium of filling out the compendium again. Dungeon exploration is standard enough, with one major problem. At the time of writing my original review, RINGO WAS SLOW AS FUCK. They mercifully added a run button a few months after the game released, and while I'm sure its a nice quality of life booster, it doesn't save the frankly boring and generic levels. With the exception of the FINAL AREA, the levels are the same 3 recycled subways, office buildings, and blank voids repeated over and over and over again, making it a huge drag to get from one story beat to the next. I really like the story here, but I'm not going to lie, some of the mid points made it really hard to continue. Luckily, these dungeons tend to be short, but with them composing most of the game, and feeling twice as long with the lack of anything interesting, they are definitely the games biggest weakness.\n\nNow, lets say you've read my little textwall, and the game sounds interesting to you. As you scroll back up to the buy button, you might notice this game has a lot of DLC. Now you're thinking \"Hmm... should I buy the deluxe edition???\"\n\nNo.\n\nThe DLC is a total waste of money. At best, you get a couple side missions that are a nice distraction from the main game for a little bit, and at worst you're spending an addition 50% of the main game's cost to completely ruin the game by instantly being able to hit level 99 with infinite money, and getting a couple neat (but totally useless) costumes. If this is like your favorite game ever and you just really wanna show your love for it, go for it I guess? But really, these are nothing more than a scummy attempt to scrape more money away from you by ripping content from the game day one that really has no business being DLC to begin with.\n\nOverall? I had a good time with Soul Hackers 2. The gameplay is pretty lacking for an SMT game, and the DLC is pretty lame, but the characters and story are such a great time, and the general aesthetic being so appealing and easy to get sucked into, that it almost carries the rest of the games weakpoints. I think this makes a great first SMT game, especially if you're looking something closer to Persona. If you're a bit more of an SMT veteran, this may be a bit harder of a sell. If the story looks cool, or you just wanna see everything this series has to offer, it's far from a terrible game, but other games in this series significantly outshine it. 6/10.", "timestamp_created": 1665038409, "timestamp_updated": 1675156137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521369040012359619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123425759": {"recommendationid": "123425759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198985946791", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3173, "last_played": 1665035537}, "language": "english", "review": "Eh, its okay.

With that said, I\u2019ve never had the chance to play any of the titles in the [i]Devil Summoner[/i] line, so basically [i]Soul Hackers 2[/i] was kind of an entry point for me.\n\nIn general, I wasn\u2019t disappointed, although it would feel more appropriate to give this one a so-so hand sign instead of a thumbs up if it was available. The whole time it felt like I was somewhere halfway between the [i]Persona[/i] and [i]Shin Megami Tensei[/i] games I\u2019ve had the chance to play so far, in a sense that the story, the characters and the art style was closer to the former, whereas the dungeons and actual gameplay reminded me of the latter. The turn-based battle system is more or less as you would expect if you\u2019re familiar with any of the aforementioned series, focusing on using demons and exploiting element weaknesses. It\u2019s fun, but still, I would have loved a bit more innovation here to shake things up sometimes, at least during boss fights. Also, be prepared for a loooot of running around in similar-looking, monotonous corridors and subway tunnels\u2026 Unfortunately, there\u2019s not much variety when it comes to level designs, which is a shame.\n\nWhat I genuinely loved, however, were the characters, especially the protagonist, who is not a mute, blank slate that requires others to communicate for her, which is quite often the case in these games.

The odd part is that they can be fixed through some configuring.[/b] Atlus announced there is a patch to add some general fixes and QoL updates coming in the near future, so these issues may be fixed by then. I did the following for the best personal experience:\n-Under \"Loading Screen Tips\" set it to either \"Hide\" or \"Button Advance\". For whatever reason this shortens load screen times drastically.\n-Lock the frame rate to 60fps, as apparently higher/uncapped rates can break some animations.\n-Adjust the camera settings so Ringo is focused in the center and the camera zoom is further away.\n-Lower analogue stick sensitivity, as Ringo can be a little slippery to control.\n\n[h1]Now for the main review[/h1]\nSoul Hackers 2 is a game I can say I personally enjoyed, but I can completely understand why others may be underwhelmed or disappointed by the final product. The fact that the first Soul Hackers is such a cult classic among RPG fans may also play a role in this game's mixed reception. As far as Shin Megami Tensei games go, it is a very mellow experience that has a lot of the pieces the series is known for but doesn't necessarily go very far with them, and as a result the game lacks the sense of scope that players familiar with the series may come to expect.\n\nIf there's one thing I'm certain Soul Hackers 2 does very well, it's the presentation. The game is incredibly stylish and beautiful with its futuristic city environments, character designs, UI and VFX, as one would expect from a modern SMT/Atlus title. The music is also great with the Opening Theme, Weapons Shop, and the multiple Battle Themes being the highlights for me. The voice cast is also full of very solid performances. Outside of looking and sounding great, it's the rest of the game, itself where one's mileage may vary.\n\n[b]Writing[/b]\nAs far as writing goes, I found the interactions among the main cast to be very enjoyable. Each party member is well fleshed out and they play off of each other very well, with Ringo and Saizo being my personal favourites. The other major characters also have some good interactions with them as well when it's their turn in the spotlight. The actual story, though, is rather lacking as far as JRPGs go. It has the pieces there to be something great, and there are a lot of compelling elements, themes, and interesting ideas that SMT is known for, however it feels like for most of the game that the story progresses just for the sake of moving the plot along.\nFor most of the game I was more compelled to see the interactions between party members and piecing together each of their backstories and how they weave together, rather than being attached to the main plot. It was only really after the major twist regarding the main antagonist that I began to feel like things were really picking up and felt engaged to continue the story, and that's roughly three quarters into the game. Fortunately I do believe the game had a satisfying enough finale and a great final boss to go with it.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe other thing that I feel a lot of people will be hit or miss on is the gameplay. Soul Hackers 2 is, in all intents and purposes, a Megami Tensei game, but it's a relatively simple Megami Tensei game. The core gameplay loop that makes SMT so addictive is all there: you explore dungeons to recruit demons, and eventually fuse those demons together to create stronger demons, allowing you to explore more dangerous dungeons. The battle system also features the series' trademark affinity system, with each demon/enemy having their own strengths and weaknesses against the different damage types in the game. It's one of personal favourite systems as far as turn-based RPGs go.\nOn top of these staple features, battles in Soul Hackers 2 features the addition of the \"Stack\" system. On top of dealing bonus damage, attacking an enemy with their weakness grants a Stack. At the end of the player's turn Ringo performs an AoE attack and deals damage based on the amount of stacks gained during their turn. It's a very simple system, though in comparison to other battle mechanics present in other SMT games, it can feel rather shallow by comparison. Even as you progress through the game and gradually unlock more perks and abilities, the Stack system doesn't provide as much strategy to battles as the \"Press Turn\" system in mainline SMT or the \"One More\" system in Persona.\n\n[b]Dungeons[/b]\nWhile the battle system can feel hit-or-miss based on your preferences, the layout and dungeon design is probably the game's lowest point in nearly every aspect. While not necessarily bad (for the most part) they are considerably boring. Dungeons in Soul Hackers 2 go back to the maze-like hallway design of older RPGs and don't really bring anything interesting to the table. Compared to other recent entries in the series like SMT V's sprawling environments and Persona 5's unique palaces, it leaves a lot to be desired\nIt also doesn't help that the environments are rather bland. The Soul Matrix, the area where you will likely spend most of your time leveling up and grinding, features 15 different floors, each one with the exact same music and background visuals (not even a change in colour scheme) and it gets very samey, very quick. The main story dungeons don't fare much better either, as they all boil down to the same idea of \"abandoned urban environment\" (two of which are abandoned subway lines) and all share the same music track, which detracts from giving each one their own sense of identity. The only exception is the final dungeon, which feels very distinct and interesting and features a unique music track that adds a lot to the atmosphere.\n\n[b]Summary[/b]\nAll in all, the best way I can describe Soul Hackers 2 is that it's a very good game to introduce newcomers to Megami Tensei as a series. It features all the core elements and gameplay loop in a way that's easy to get the gist of. It isn't brutally difficult like Mainline SMT, and it isn't a massive time sink like Persona. It's just enough to give players a taste of everything this truly unique franchise of RPGs has to offer. That being said, do I recommend getting this game at full price? No, not really. I would still say wait until it goes on sale for like half off. If you can get this game at a decent price then I can comfortably say you're in for an experience that, while somewhat flawed, is still very much worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1664954771, "timestamp_updated": 1664954771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49959215521812439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123367025": {"recommendationid": "123367025", "author": {"steamid": "76561199150170882", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 116, "last_played": 1661562668}, "language": "english", "review": "nope, wait for a sale if you really want to buy it\nedit: get it on gamepass instead. its worth the $1 price", "timestamp_created": 1664927648, "timestamp_updated": 1677620678, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.4752330482006073", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123317250": {"recommendationid": "123317250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198995652350", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "playtime_at_review": 197, "last_played": 1676771712}, "language": "english", "review": "Is Fun, I like it", "timestamp_created": 1664846880, "timestamp_updated": 1664846880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123298384": {"recommendationid": "123298384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066467794", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3650, "last_played": 1663884995}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy Atlus games, so I really enjoyed it.

You win some, you lose some. And this time I lost some. I wouldn't recommend this. I got almost every achievement so here's my two cents.\n\nThe long and the short of it: The best part of this game is basically the art style, characters, voice work, and the weapon shop and Mansei Realm music slaps! ...otherwise the music is a mixed bag. The story is unremarkable, but has a few twists to be enjoyable. Boss fights on hard mode are challenging and satisfying to beat. Speaking of boss fights the primary mechanic in this game, the sabbath attack, is actually still relevant during boss fights instead of completely thrown out like in the Persona games. While the worst of it was the extremely boring dungeon settings and design.\n\nThe main protagonist Ringo is surprising charming and silly. The artwork had me thinking she'd be a cold leader type and since she's some kind of robot/AI/android, so I figured they might've leaned into that kind of trope. Then Saizo I thought seemed too tropey from the artwork, but I ended up liking him the most, besides Ringo, with how he developed. Because the voice work is done by proven talents, the characters come to life and their banter is enough to keep me going through these long dark endless hallways.\n\nThe game's basic story premise you can read in this game's description page never really develops beyond that. Despite that there are some twists and turns towards the second half of the story. Even Saizo acknowledges the amount of twists at this point in the game. With that said, the story is nothing to write home about, but it has its moments and I enjoyed it enough.\n\nThe gameplay loop essentially boils down to crawling these massive boring dungeons, getting to a checkpoint and leaving to rest, upgrade or do a hangout. Which to me is immersion  breaking because the game sets things in the main story thread to be urgent, but it feels weird to leave the dungeon to have a beer with your party mates. You just have to suspend disbelief here. Maybe I'm too used to the Persona dungeon and daily life cycle. Speaking of Persona, I fee like the party member hangouts here seem tacked on because of Persona's popularity.\n\nAs far as gameplay systems go, the sabbath attack is basically a weaker all-out attack from Persona and hitting weaknesses doesn't stun enemies, but you can stack up the damage and it's actually relevant in boss fights unlike in Persona which is a plus. When you progress in a party member's soul matrix dungeon you learn abilities for them that can affect how these characters can add to the stack. However, it's pretty much on rails. You play the party members as they're designed to be. It's a beginners trap in thinking you can make Ringo a good ice user because her ice bonuses from mistique unlocks never go up that high and she doesn't get stack bonuses from them anyway.\n\nI played the game on hard right from the start and I will praise the game for its tight balancing. Boss fights are challenging and satisfying to beat. The soul matrix quest bosses can be very tricky especially because you often aren't allowed any items or commander skills and have a time limit. I always took these bosses at the recommended level and always eventually found some kind of combo to win. However, since you can, eventually, leave a dungeon and come back at any time and can skip random encounters as you please normal enemies don't pose the threat of attrition on your resources like in other JRPGs. They are just pi\u00f1atas to beat for loot and XP. This further adds to the monotony of dungeons.\n\nI've been beating up the dungeons in this whole review so let's get to it. By now, many reviews pan this game's bland dungeons and that word really doesn't describe how bad they really are. They are all long dreary corridors with usually nothing of interest to see or do and they all have the same ambient piano track playing for all of them except for the soul matrix dungeons which has its own track that's shared between them.  if you don't mind spoilers all the dungeons are basically: [spoiler]an abandoned subway[/spoiler], [spoiler]an abandoned office tower[/spoiler], and [spoiler]some shipping ports[/spoiler]. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the environments which all share the neon future aesthetic so it really confuses me why they went this direction for the dungeons. Only the final dungeon has any interesting design to it. Now if you played Persona 4, you might be familiar with the long corridor dungeon design, but at least there at each stage of the game it had a different theme and music. Of course if you played and liked Persona 3 then you'll be right at home with the never ending dark corridors!\n\nNow the dungeons do sometimes have a puzzle to solve which helps break up the monotony. One dungeon has doors closing behind you and it was interesting enough to solve. Then a few soul matrix dungeons have a \"pick a door\" teleporter puzzle where if you pick the wrong one you're punished with being sent backwards and having to walk back to it. Game design nowadays have a lot of padding to prevent people from complaining a game is too short, but this is particularly egregious.\n\nFinally, this game's default camera is awful. I had to adjust the settings multiple times so I can see where I'm going.\n\nOverall, this game is a missed opportunity. It could've used some more time in the oven, but I feel like a resurrected 20+ year old franchise isn't going to get the funds to develop a more fleshed out game. However, if you think you might like the characters in a very anime-ish end-of-the-world story, then I'd recommend playing this on easy/normal and just getting to the story bits ASAP.", "timestamp_created": 1664680943, "timestamp_updated": 1664681978, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634028971195220947", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "123190551": {"recommendationid": "123190551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065475920", "num_games_owned": 542, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1222, "last_played": 1663978592}, "language": "english", "review": "Soul Hackers 2 on paper is one of the JRPGs I always wanted, I love the story and characters of SH2, and enjoy the world that is being set up, but I feel like Atlus played this one too safe, I feel like this game could have felt much bigger and more alive.

There are even lazy design choices at time. The dungeons in particular are uninspired and in some cases confusing in design or copy-paste boredom. The developers even forgot to put a run button/mechanic for the dungeons and your character plods along (seriously irritating) and then you have to activate an ability every 20 seconds until the end of the game to feel right while running around.\n\nThe one thing the game did do to push this type of game forward was changes to the combat system.

I enjoyed the game, quite a bit, and I still regret buying it at full price. It starts off somewhat rocky, but after it lets you off the leash, the game becomes really fun. And then after a while, it just becomes disappointing. Although I have to admit, I was disappointed right at the get-go.\n\nIf you were expecting a sequel to Soul Hackers 1, from the words 'Soul Hackers' and the number 2 in the title, then you'll be disappointed. This game owes more to persona 5 than any game in the devil summoner series. Whats the difference you might ask? Devil summoner games are usually first person dungeon crawlers where the player starts out weak and then evolve into a gun toting, sword swinging, demon summoning badass. Soul Hackers 2, meanwhile, is a 3rd person dungeon crawler where you fight demons as a party of 4 unique characters who deepen their friendship over the course of the story. Sound familiar? But that was only the start of my disappointments.\n\nThe artstyle of the game is really good. Very pretty, good character designs, the works. The thing about it, though, and it might take you a while to realise this, when it comes to graphics, the game is pretty shit. The environment looks pretty dated, character models don't emote very much, and they recycle almost all of the attack effects. Animation is pretty weak in general in this game, the most notable example being Ringo's walk cycle. It's rather stiff and somewhat awkward, and since she's the main character, this is probably going to end up bothering you a lot.\n\nVoice acting is pretty alright overall. The 4 leads have pretty decent voice acting, but Ringo's voice acting is just a bit off. Most of the time it'll be fine, but there's certain times where the quality dips. And again, since she's the main character, this is going to end up bothering you a lot. Music is alright too, not really any notable tracks.\n\nThe gameplay is normal SMT fare, with the notable absence of light and dark instant kill spells. That means that random mobs won't randomly one-shot you, which is nice, I guess, and that's about it as far as gameplay differences go. Dark spells are debuffs, and they also do damage and exploit weaknesses so it's not bad. Building up the 4 characters is also pretty engaging, because the materials you need to upgrade them aren't always found in the same dungeon, so you'll upgrade different affinities at different times. \n\nYou'll never really need to farm if you keep up with axis unlocks. The axis is the main side dungeon, basically, and you clear it out for some pretty nice character buffs. The issue with the axis, though, is that you'll be going there a lot, the scenery never changes, and it's used to pad out the rest of the game. The main issue with Soul Hackers 2 is that it's really not a long game, but it makes itself feel like it's much longer. I have just finished the game with 60 hours, 50% of which was spent in the axis, 25% I spent on loading screens, and probably 25% I spent in the actual story and story dungeons. There's just not a lot of content, and around the halfway mark, you'll notice things repeating themselves. As for the story itself, it's alright. There's a really actually quite solid (if somewhat cliche) twist in the lategame, sandwiched between 1 ok twist and another twist that's pretty poorly built up. The characters are alright and they get more fleshed out over the course of the plot, though they start off pretty one-dimensional. I'd give the story a passing grade, for whatever it's worth, considering you won't interact with it much. Though I should note that I almost didn't bother finishing the game because it was just so samey by the end dungeon, but I figured I might as well have just bitten the bullet.\n\nOverall, this is kind of a disappointing game for something that has the balls to say that it's full price. If you really want to play something like this you might as well just play Persona 4 Golden, which has more content AND a better story, and it's only about a 3rd of what Soul Hackers 2 is selling for. If you really, really, really want to play this, I'd wait for a sale.

Sure the dungeons visually are a mess but the character development, the combat, the story, I think are pretty good, a lot of the themes are very mature and reflect things people go through in real life. There's a few glaring flaws with the dungeons as I mentioned, the walk speed and fusions feeling limited in potential. Combat is also fun with how customization for each of the characters work. It's not a terrible game. If anything I think people had there expectations set on a successor to Persona 5 Royal, if you go into any game, comparing it to another. your almost always going to have a bad time. Soul Hackers 2 is a fun experimental game made as a revival of a 25 year old franchise. It's not trying to surpass Persona 5, or Shin Megami Tensei V, just being it's own thing and try something different, while appealing to older fans of the series. feel free to keep hating it if you want, I enjoyed my time with the game, and I hope whoever reads this found something they liked too.  If you do genuinely hate the game, your opinion is yours to have, and I'm sorry you feel like you wasted your time and money on it.\n\nPersonally I liked the complexity of the dungeons, visually they failed i agree, but i liked actually having to \"solve\" the later dungeons. there's that 'ah-ha!' moment when finally progressing that made them really satisfying to work through. the 1 way door mechanic in the subways felt like a more fleshed out version of what they tried at the end of Shin Megami Tensei V, as well as dungeons from the PersonaQ games, all i ever hear is people hating how complicated the dungeons are. but that's strictly a personal thing, and not a 'flaw' of the game. If the layouts were the same but each of the soul matrix's had unique and striking visuals with there own music and themes would you still hate it? The demons could have also been replaced with chests, but instead they chose to show us demon's from our party, a lot of people tend to overlook this but it was kind of cool getting to see Ringo standing next to your demons and interacting with them.\n \nAlso I personally enjoyed the DLC story, it's not connected to the main plot at all aside from just a hint of extra context for the ending, even then it just feels like a filler episode, extra fluff. it doesn't takes anything away from the game not having it, but for those who like the game it's a nice side story that's fully voiced and fun to play through while adding an extra dungeon to explore, and adding some of the hardest fights in the game for those who really want to push the limit.\n\nI just find it strange that this game is literally getting a worse overall rating than Balan Wonderworld.

Just a mostly bland experience.\n\nThe worst issue with this game is that it takes what already works in other SMT games, and changes them for the worst. For example, exploiting weaknesses isn't rewarded by an extra press turn, or being able to act again. Instead, you do slightly more damage at the end of a turn. And instead of having your turn taken away for using something the enemy blocks, there's now no punishment besides the usual things. (Doing no damage, Healing the enemy, Attack being reflected) You're still rewarded for using the right skills in the right situation, but thanks to these changes, you can pretty much just spam the most powerful move you have without very many consequences, making the entire combat system uninteresting.\n\nCombat's not the only thing that's been made worse. Demon negotiation has pretty much been removed. Now you just find demons while exploring, and they'll always join you if you give them a worthless item or two. \n\nSkill affinities have also been removed. Demons are no longer good with different types of skills from a scale of -8 to 8, there's just skills they can and can't have. This makes fusing a chain of demons to make a specific demon with a specific set of skills extremely frustrating. Not only do you have to find a demon with the skill you want, you now have to find a set of demons that can all inherit that skill, and be fused in a chain of fusions to make a single demon with a single skill that you want. This takes forever, even with a fusion calculator. \n\nAnother thing that has been changed is no longer having demon allies. Instead, you have the same party members that can use the skills of a demon, kind of like the first 3 persona games. This isn't a huge change or anything, but because the demon is nothing more than something you equip, making a new powerful demon doesn't feel nearly as rewarding, knowing all it does is give your party member some slightly different skills than before.\n\nThere's a lot of other smaller changes that do nothing but make things worse, but those aren't really worth noting.\n\nEven if you don't compare this to previous games, this still does a lot wrong. Exploring is what you'll be doing for half of the game, and the places you explore are boring both visually, and layout-wise. Dungeons are just barely decorated long hallways and mazes. Even the gimmicks are bland, the later soul matrix levels overuse the hell out of teleporters, and still somehow does nothing interesting with them.\n\nAnother thing that I absolutely hate that this does is locking features that do nothing but make the game less frustrating. Ringo is painfully slow, it can take over 30 seconds just to go from one end of a hallway to another. You can get a speed upgrade around 10 hours into the game, but even then, you have to re-apply it every minute, and it cost MP.\n \nThe DLC is some of the worst I've ever seen, but that's been talked about enough.\n\nIt's not all bad though. Outside of the dungeons, the game is very good visually, if a little generic. Even if things like combat and fusion are worse than usual, I still occasionally had fun with it. The story is okay, which is surprising considering how some of the recent games in this series have turned out. \n\nBesides having all my save data corrupted (Which was an easy fix, just delete everything except your autosave folder.), I didn't have any technical issues with it. The default settings are terrible though, please change them if you haven't, especially the loading screen option which adds 10 seconds of artificial loading.\n\nOverall, I don't recommend this, but I can't say I regret playing it. This game has a lot of good things in it that I didn't mention here, but unfortunately the negatives outweigh the positives. At it's worst, it's boring.

There is a part of the game where, once you complete a dungeon that takes place in a subway system, you have to go right back into another full length subway dungeon. This is just bad game design, plain and simple. Revisiting dungeons is fine when these visits are spaced out enough as to not make the player bored, but there was no effort made to space these dungeons out at all. Additionally, the Soul Matrix is bland and uninteresting. It\u2019s just a sea of blue cubes meant to be all hacker themed, which is fine, but the Soul Matrix is meant to be done over the course of the game. Nothing about this dungeon changes at all between floors, or depending on whose Soul Matrix it is. This is only two dungeons I really had a problem with, sure the others weren\u2019t super interesting but they were at least fine. I liked the dungeon where you kept getting into forced encounters that drained your MP, as it forced you to defeat the group of enemies with limited resources. \nIn terms of combat, the combat system was fine. It was fun enough, but not as fun as mainline SMT or Persona. The main thing is Sabbath attacks that occur at the end of every player turn if you strike a weakness. Each attack that strikes a weakness adds a stack to this attack, and you can unlock ways to get more stacks depending on the element used or by certain commander skills. There is some satisfaction in getting very high stacks and dealing some massive damage, though the damage never seemed really significant to me, even when using every demon in my stock. Though maybe that\u2019s just me, either way it\u2019s still fun, but that\u2019s all there really is to the combat. Other than that it\u2019s SMT. \nThe story was alright, definitely a step up from SMT V. I haven\u2019t finished the story because frankly I got bored once I had to mandatorily revisit the Soul Matrix, so I can\u2019t comment much on it. There are some twists and turns, the characters are enjoyable (except Mimi), and the English voice acting is aight. Again, haven\u2019t finished the story because again, boring dungeon made me bored. \nGrinding in this game isn\u2019t bad at all, as the meal system provides meals that can give you even more EXP from fighting higher level enemies. Meals can increase stats or buff your party in some way, and wear off when you leave whatever dungeon you enter. These meals aren\u2019t hard to get, and you\u2019ll likely end up with more than you need just from your allies giving them to you. The meal system is pretty neat and adds some level of strategization when preparing for a boss. \nThere\u2019s a hangout system where, after certain events or sidequests, you unlock a hangout event where you get to talk to one or some characters at the bar. These are kind of neat, but if you don\u2019t care about them you don\u2019t have to do them. \n\nOverall this game is just alright. Buy it on sale if you\u2019re interested as this game isn\u2019t really worth the $60. I haven\u2019t covered every element of this game, mostly just the things that stood out to me as good or bad.

I enjoyed Ringo immensely and how she interacted with Milady, Arrow and Saizo. I loved the cute little lines the demons tell you when they're out on recon in the dungeons. All of the dumb filler lines were great. The soundtrack for the last dungeon slaps hard. There were many different types of hee-hos. I really loved Milady. The EN and JP voice acting was amazing. That's all I really have to say that's positive.\n\nNow the negatives is just a long laundry list of stuff that really disappointed me as a longtime SMT fan. For one, the story was just so lacklustre and short. It only felt like the game was long because there was just so much filler. Everything related to the narrative picked up at the last dungeon and I got myself worked up only to find that it was the end. They could've done so much more with some of the characters and their backstories, especially Arrow. Throughout my playthrough of the game, all I could think about the entire time was \"wow, Ishikawa Kaito really was typecasted for Arrow\" because he was just so bland even with all of those later-game background revelations. The last dungeon could've easily been the midpoint of the game, but it just wasn't and I felt like my hype was for nothing. I hated the Soul Matrix designs and found myself immensely frustrated trying to figure out the 4F/5F of everyone's matrices. I felt that the game was really grindy and annoying, even though I was playing on not Hard Mode. I'm not a huge fan of whatever Persona-esque battle system is used (I'm a press turn stan). \n\nOverall, the game just felt rushed. I felt like I got half of a game and that they could've done a lot more with it. I'm not sure if it's even worth playing.

Its greatest strength are its characters, all of whom are very likable and have had their own traumas that made them grow into who they are, and they very frequently have an air of moral ambiguity to them, even when you wouldn't initially expect it. The dialogue is hip and modern, and yet, unlike Persona, which is hard not to compare this against, more adult to fit in line with its characters all of which are adults.\nCombat is your standard turn-based fair, but instead of the typical bonus turn from older Megaten press turn titles, you get a bonus attack of varying power depending upon how many times you exploit the enemies weaknesses. I appreciate its long winding dungeons; in some ways they're reminiscient of the dungeon crawlers in the series early titles, which could be very mazelike. This game is no different, though admittedly it takes a while for the dungeons to become more complicated and interesting. Eventually you get teleport puzzles and other environmental puzzles, but early on a lot of the maps will be very samey. Once you get past that though it really gets going.\nThe game is very pretty and its music is pretty solid too.

I'd recommend it, but understand what you're getting into.\n\nThe most popular genre example I can make is Persona 3 FES, The Answer. In The Answer, which was an expansion to the original Persona 3, the entire \"game\" was dungeons and minor story sections. That was it. No social links, no slice of life, no sidequests, nothing else. You went from dungeon to dungeon, midboss to midboss. The combat of SMT and its spinoffs has always been strong, but it gets to the point of staleness.\n\nI would compare Soul Hackers 2 to The Answer with slightly more story content.\n\nThere are two types of dungeons - story dungeons, which exist as real-world locations, and the Soul Matrix, which is an isolated Tartarus- or Mementos-like series of dungeons that all share the same aesthetic. The dungeons are not procedurally-generated, so once you've cleared an entire map, you're good. However, each type of dungeon only gets one audio track, so you will be hearing the same two tracks for hours on end. And there are also no changes to battle themes apart from what you get in boss and midboss encounters.\n\nYou get your full party early on and then don't get any more members for the rest of the story. The five lead characters (four party members plus the navi) are somewhat one-note, but still interesting enough. The party members engage in playful banter during battles that also serve as audio cues in case you're not paying attention to weaknesses or resistances. Because you're dealing with five characters, instead of eight or nine like in Persona, there's a stronger, more consistent sense of comradeship among the team.\n\nThe plot takes a lot of time to seriously get going and has the potential to turn people off early on out of boredom. Once it does, late in the game, it's just as exciting as other good Atlus games. However, it relies very heavily on MacGuffins, and changing the rules of said MacGuffins on the fly, which is super-tropey and may also turn people off. There are also instances where no-name characters show up like they're insanely important figures in the story only to never be seen again after one or few appearances.\n\nThe combat is the highlight and is very strong... Some of the challenge bosses are like puzzles that will take you several tries to figure out. Hitting an enemy weakness builds a counter which results in a large AOE attack every turn. As you progress through the game and gain party member skills, you can rack up insanely large counters, resulting in a crazy-satisfying attack.\n\nThe game is obviously lower-budget compared to something like Persona 5 or SMT 5, but thankfully it is still polished with minimal noticeable bugs or performance issues. I did not purchase the DLCs, and my review of this game does not take any of them into consideration.\n\nAgain, I recommend it, though understand that it's a very, very, very combat-focused game going in.", "timestamp_created": 1663464967, "timestamp_updated": 1663464967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495599806308746338", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122396065": {"recommendationid": "122396065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198339569370", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 4199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4199, "last_played": 1663446342}, "language": "english", "review": "Persona 5 Royal doesn't release for another month", "timestamp_created": 1663447113, "timestamp_updated": 1663447113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448043555021286011", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122395545": {"recommendationid": "122395545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306344212", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 391, "last_played": 1661707801}, "language": "english", "review": "The only thing I liked about this game were the tweaks done to the dungeons.

I'll start with the positives I guess.\nPros:\n-Soul Hackers 2 has some really nice visual designs and presentation, I really liked the aesthetic overall, the whole cybery futuristic dystopia is nice, as well as the character designs themselves, be it the main cast or the extra shop owner characters like Victor or the quest giver Madam Ginko, the designs are top notch\n-Demon Fusion is still fun to do, although it feels pretty much unchanged from other games, so nothing too interesting, but at least it still works as intended\n-Game doesn't have any massive bugs (that I'm aware of) and runs fairly smoothly\n-Music is alright, nothing too spectacular given ATLUS's track record, but passable\n-Voice work was really good in this game, in both English and Japanese\n-Saizo is kinda based sometimes\n\n\nNow onto the bad...we're gonna be here for a while\n\nCons:\n-Small nitpick to start, the default game options are godawful, the default camera angle and FOV make exploring dungeons a nightmare but thankfully you can change that. Same goes for loading screen tips artificially inflating load times, they can be disabled thankfully\n\n-Characters are really boring in this game, genuinely some of the most forgettable characters in any game I've played recently except Saizo, and he's just alright at best, the only memorable part about Arrow, Milady, Figue, Ringo, Raven, and so on, are their visual designs, otherwise they have nothing that makes them stand out, Arrow being generic anime good guy, and Milady being the \"tough girl who refuses to open up, but has a soft spot for children\" as her entire character, Raven ends up being a \"morally grey\" villain who wants to save these orphans by...destroying the world?!?! It doesn't make sense and is hardly morally grey, it's just bland\n\n-Story is very very VERY generic anime, and very very forgettable, starts with standard megaten \"apocalypse\" plot, but it tells you everything important within the first 2 hours, like Yatagarasu, Phantom Society, the Covenants, summoning the Great One, yadayada, it shows its hand right away and then barely builds on it at all, the numerous plot twists are all predictable and fail to make me care about what happens next. Like, the whole Soul Hacking thing barely even comes into play throughout the entire game, only like 6 times in the ENTIRE story is Soul Hacking even used, 3 times for your party members, 1 time for Arrow to give the purple covenant, 1 time failed with Figue and Raven, and 1 time to rescue Figue on one of the endings.\nAll the story exposition happens in one of two locations, the safehouse, or the orphanage, and very rarely in the Axis itself.\nThe whole story revolves around gathering the covenants to stop the end of the world...that's it. The individual character stories are pretty bland as well or just handled poorly, and speaking of being handled poorly, character stories happen in the Soul Matrix or during the hangout scenes at the bar. The Soul Matrix sucks major ass, and the hangout scenes aren't engaging enough to be memorable, which only further hurts the memorability of the characters. The game has 2 endings, both are similar and neither of them are very interesting, effectively leaving things off virtually unchanged from the start of the game. \n\n-Gameplay: I'm gonna split this one into two parts, Dungeon Crawling and Combat.\n\n    -Dungeon crawling: Oh man this is by FAR the worst aspect of this game, having to explore and return to the various \"dungeons\" as they barely qualify as.\nThis game has multiple boring dungeons, between the shipping areas, the subway lines, the towers, and the Soul Matrix, the only one that felt even slightly different was the final dungeon, and it still sucked hard.\nThe shipping districts are just small containted areas, nothing special about either of them, West or East shipping districts.\n\nThe Subway lines are just that, abandoned subway lines with almost nothing of interest except for this one door puzzle that goes away after you beat it, and there are 2 of these identical subway dungeons for you to mindlessly roam around in.\n\nThe Ozaki Hope towers are a smidge more interesting, with the elevator puzzle, but that's about it, otherwise it's the same mindless roaming around, aside from this one segment where you go through the vents as Mimi, the little owl navigator bot, which is extremely slow and still have to deal with enemies while doing so.....it sucks, plain and simple\n\nThe Municipal tower is this weirdish dungeon with doors and \"teleporters\" that transport you either up or down depending on the flow of the water...and that's it.\n\nSoul Matrix, the dungeon you revisit the most because there's 1 for each character except ringo, so you have 3 identical dungeons, that boil down to doors, telporters, and a second version of teleporters....yay....\n\nI just listed eveything unique between all of the dungeons, now here's the flaws they all share.\nAll of them are enormous, long, spiraling empty halls with nothing to do except fight or run past enemies....which makes exploring them not only very tedious over the course of the roughly 60 hours of main story progression, but very boring as well.\nOn top of having boring empty halls for every dungeon, enemies spawn every two seconds, forcing you to stop and swat them away, wasting time.\nActually progressing through these dungeons really sucks when you realize that Ringo moves slower than a paralytic grandma who just got shot in the knees, and the only way to speed her up is by using a skill that costs 10 MP to speed you up for like 20ft worth of distance, which you can only unlock by progressing Milady's Soul Matrix....\nAlso the navigator is insanely annoying, someone invented a mod just to shut the navigator up...that much should be self explanatory.\n\n\nCombat: BUCKLE UP FUCKOS BECAUSE THIS RANT IS GONNA BE MORE INTERESTING THAN THE BATTLE SYSTEM\n\n-Battling: You and your party members can each equip some gear, augment mistiques, and a demon each\ncombat is turn based and lacks the fun aspects of other smt games, like the press turn system, or even the baton pass from Persona 5, and 1more function from Persona 3 onwards. Instead you are rewarded with a Sabbath for hitting weaknesses....which is just damage at the end of your turn to all enemies....for doing the normal thing...so the gimmick with combat is a non interactive reward for playing the game normally....lame...and you can only upgrade it through having certain demon skills or stack bonuses applied, but it fundamentally remains the same.\n      There's no sabbaths for enemies either, so the enemies are always at a disadvantage to you, which is an oddity for SMT and Persona, as enemies could take advantage of both Press turns, and 1more in those games.\n      Light and Dark skills are gone entirely, replaced with Ruin, which is basically just ailment moves that also deal damage...\n      Without any sort of interactive gimmick, battles become really boring, especially with the removal of Demon Negotiation putting the final nail in the coffin, it just devolves to hitting the weakness and moving on, no strategy or tactics in any capacity.\nWith a lack of strats, progression just becomes a boring grind.\n\nI have more I could say, but I can't fit much more into this steam review, so here's my final verdict\n\nGame has good visuals and presentation, everything else is shit, and I can't recommend it, even if you're a longtime fan of the series. 2/10, don't buy it, even on a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1663299379,

rank this about a 4/10. Good characters, reasonable combat, barely adequate soundtrack, bad plot, terrible dungeons, infuriating navigator.\n\n\"Uninspired\" would be the word I would use to summarize this game. The core concept was fine, but almost everything surrounding that concept ranged from bland to terrible to downright rage-inducing.\n\nI liked the individual characters. Ringo had just the right amount of sass, Saizo was cool without being a complete smarmodon, Milady wanted to set everything on fire, and Arrow had kind of a stick up his butt in a way that gave him a good contrast to the others. (Arrow's voice kind of reminded me of Yosuke from Persona 4, if Yosuke were a lot calmer and a bit older, which I liked.)\n\nCombat was fine. It was a pretty standard variation on the basic SMT/Persona/etc. system. The Sabbaths were an interesting halfway point between SMT V's press turn system and Persona's all-out attacks.\n\nControls and menus were a little clunky. Ringo moves like she's on ice skates, with a large delay before she starts moving at her full speed and a large delay between no longer pressing forward on the controller and when she actually comes to a stop. It's funny when you run up to a demon or NPC and press the button to talk to them, then watch Ringo slide to a stop ten feet past them while the dialogue is going.\n\nMusic was unmemorable. Coming from the entire Persona series before this, I was very disappointed in this.\n\nThe dungeons were TERRIBLE. There were two dungeons in dark and visually unappealing shipping yards. Two in dark and visually unappealing subways. A DLC dungeon in a dark indoor treehouse that looked like it could have been built in vanilla Minecraft. Three dungeons where everything was just different shades of blue and the floors floated in blue nothingness. And one dungeon in a tower that was inexplicably half an undersea theme and half pathways made of bones with gestating fetuses in the sky.\n\nThose three blue dungeons were infuriating. Starting on floor 3 of each of them, they became mazes of one-way teleporters between short little bits of platforms. The teleporters largely had no discernible logic to them. One place, as far as I was able to tell from the single guide that exists in the entire Internet for this floor that was all in Japanese, had a set of teleporters that had to be entered in a specific order, with absolutely zero hint or guidance in-game to indicate that.\n\nThe undersea dungeon was somehow more rage-inducing, possibly because I'd already spent hours with those stupid teleporters. Again, one-way teleporters, this time with a metric ton of backtracking in between each one. This isn't fun. This isn't interesting. This is just artificially inflating the play time.\n\nAnd while I'm on about the dungeons...Mimi. Oh my god, Mimi. Imagine Navi from Ocarina of Time, but turned up to 11. For every single enemy, she tells you there's an enemy, she tells you the enemy has spotted you, and she tells you when you've neutralized the enemy. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. And her lines never vary! And the enemies make sound themselves when they spawn anyway! She never tells you anything you can't see for yourself literally right in front of you! Fortunately there's a mod to shut her up otherwise I would have given up on the game about ten hours in.\n\nThe plot is paper-thin. Characters react to things in strange ways. There are multiple instances where one minute they're like \"we've gotta hurry and do this thing!\" and the next minute they're all \"welp, we're tired, time to call it a day\". At the start of the game, Ringo says \"I can't just Soul Hack whenever I feel like it\" and then proceeds to Soul Hack three times in short succession, so, so much for that, I guess?", "timestamp_created": 1663212509, "timestamp_updated": 1663212509, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49149283766746521", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122257002": {"recommendationid": "122257002", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009288148", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1941, "last_played": 1663211059}, "language": "english", "review": "this is not a bad game, especially the English voice caste did a phenomenal job, and normally I would have given it a thumbs up but ...\nI got this right after spending 180 hours in another Switch exclusive JRPG which is vastly superior in every aspect.

If you expect something of persona or mainline SMT quality, this game is not it.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time with this game but it has some major flaws keeping it from being a 8/10 for me.\n\nThis game is supposed to be a budget title and you can see it ingame, which is why I don't recommend buying this game at 60 dollars if you're not a huge Shin Megami Tensei fans (Go grab P5R instead if you haven't played it).\n\nWhat I like:\n- The characters. Ringo is a great main character with actual personalities\n- Progression system is fun with a lot of customization opportunities\n- Sabbath and commander skills are neat ideas\n- Stress-free combat for casual players like me (but it can be too way easy at times)\n- The game respects your time by allowing you to save and quit anywhere\n- A few great tracks with huge Nier vibes, as expected from Monaca\n- Good story, not great but it's a breath of fresh air from Persona and SMT games\n- 40 hours main story, a good length for this game\n\nWhat I don't like\n- The dungeons. Even though I'm used to navigating bad dungeon designs (looking at you Tales of Berseria) it doesn't mean that I give them a pass, especially for a 60 dollars game. By the end of the game I just spam Assassin Steps to rush through dungeons.\n- The lack of variety. This one is the biggest flaw for me. In Persona games, the randomly generated dungeons change overtime in terms of soundtrack and overall theme. In Soul Hackers 2, there's only 1 track for Story dungeons, 1 other track for Soul Matrix, 1 track for every single story boss, etc.\n- Combat is too easy with every single enemy advantages removed from hitting your weak points\n- Demons and some materials require a lot of running around and pray that RNGesus will give you what you actually want\n- Skill inheritance isn't explained very clearly. I still don't know how they pick which skills to inherit by the end of the game.\n- Shitty DLC practices.

While I miss Press Turn & One More from other sub-franchises, Sabbaths are fun. I just wish critical adds weren't locked behind upgrades and were in the system by default. Demon inheritance is a thing, but not every demon can learn every element. It's a shame, because the attribute system in SMTV seemed like the most fun way to balance demon builds. Beyond that, if you like MegaTen combat, you'll like it here too.\n-Great characters. With how goofy most of the cast looked, I wasn't expecting much; perhaps that's why was blown away by the quality of the character writing. Each character has a unique perspective and character traits while still feeling reasonable why they'd help Ringo and without feeling one-note.\n\nCons:\n-Ringo moves very slowly through dungeons. There is a speed boost skill you can get early on, but it doesn't last very long and is tedious to repeatedly activate.\n-The dungeons are boring and repetitive. There aren't many dungeons in this game, and the ones that are feel very short and bland. There are two in particular that I consistently had to check against quest and demon locations because I could not tell them apart visually. MegaTen games typically have some interesting dungeon puzzles; there are only two of such in this game, and calling them puzzles feels like an overreach. They can be bruteforced very easily, and don't feel satisfying. I'm not asking for Nocturne-level warp dungeons, but a little more content would have gone a long way.\n-The story is apparent within the first half-hour of gameplay. The character writing carries the entire game on its back.\n-This game only feels loosely connected to Soul Hackers. There are a couple of character references and Soul Hacking happens. That's it.\n-The music is serviceable. Disappointing when compared to Persona 5 and SMTV, the latest entries in the other two major Megaten franchises under Atlus' belt.\n\nAll in all, if Atlus was attempting to make Devil Summoner the third pillar in their roster, they failed. This game was underfunded, lacking in distinct content, and generally feels like it could have used more time in the oven.\n\nDLC Rating:\n-I have no opinion on costumes. It's pricey, but honestly changing the battle theme to the original Soul Hackers one was worth it to me.\n-Demons being such expensive DLC-- ON LAUNCH-- is criminal. This game already wasn't given enough budget or time to come out well, and bad launch-day DLC practices only hurt this game even more.\n--Lost Numbers is okay. Nana is a fun character, but all other associated content is either very short or insanely repetitive. The only highlight is the [spoiler]Superboss included in this DLC[/spoiler].\n--Ring-ho should not have been DLC, much less locked to the DIGITAL DELUXE EDITION.\n\nRecommendation: The game is fun, but not worth the $90 Atlus is asking for what feels like the \"full\" game. I still recommend buying it, but only with a good discount during a steam sale.

Initial impressions set my expectations to something close to Tokyo Mirage Session however the lighting and shading work lends it somewhere closer to a noir comic book like style. If you enjoyed PS2 Megaten games (like I do) the game navigates kinda similar, in a close up 3rd person view. The controls are a bit difficult and throw you off but they aren't intolerable. The combat system is highly controversial, and I can't say for late game, but initial impressions are interesting to say the least.\nPeople are disappointed that Press Turn isn't the system that Atlus went with, and while I also enjoy press turn this was to be expected even before the games release. Devil Summoner games (which this game should fall under) tends to be Atlus's test bed for different combat systems. Devil Summoner 1 and Soul Hacker has its loyalty system, Raidou Kuzunoha has its real-time battle system, and Soul Hacker 2 has the Sabbath system. Its sort of like 5's essence system and 3's magatama system. The player character gains the affinity of the demons they have selected and use demon skills during their turn. The player doesn't summon the demon to the field, rather they use the demons skill directly, and if the skill is especially effective against a foe the demon will stick around till the end of the round. At the end of a combat round the demons engage in a Sabbath and inflict extra damage against the enemy party. The side effect of this system is characters can only summon 1 demon each, a maximum of 4 per party. Its a far cry from the 4+ party characters and I can see it leading to less complex party set ups compared to Soul Hacker 1, but once again this isn't the first time Devil Summoner has limited the active demons in a player party. It's not the worst combat system but I can see why many don't like it compared to the other games. I enjoy it (as of writing this) but it's worth knowing this is the main gameplay for this game. The combat animations are exceptional, all characters have a stylish aura and demeanor (yes even the guy in the hoody, he looks cooler in person than in the trailer).\nPeople often ask why Soul Hacker 2, rather than Devil Summoner: Aion or whatever. Besides Soul Hacking being a main story mechanic it probably has to do with its themes being directly connected to Soul Hacker's. Where Soul Hacker's main themes and setting was all about the exponential growth of technological capability and how the explosion of tech in the 90s was rapidly changing the living standards of all people, Soul Hackers 2 directly follows it up with modern days continued technological growth and yet somehow the stagnation of human living standards. Even if tech is still getting better as the years have gone on we as people haven't been greatly changed. Not in any utopian way that the 90s had envisioned it atleast. Only time will tell if this theme is fully realized but I can at least understand the Soul Hacker 2 monicure.\n\nTLDR/Conclusion;\nI'm not saying this is the best game or even one of the best. Its probably not going to break new ground in the SMT fandom in terms of story or gameplay, as many have pointed out in there own Reviews. However I see very little reason as of now to not recommend it to people who enjoy SMT and Atlus games in general. If you set your expectations to that of a decent, if simpler take on Devil Summoner I doubt you will be disappointed. I see very little reason to by the game full priced and with DLC. I only did it because I like to support Atlus's game developers. I honestly have never played a bad Atlus game. Many tedious and some that were kinda boring, but never bad. Play on Hard if you are familiar with Atlus games (its closer to other Atlus games Normal, and remember there is a Very Hard that should be closer to the expected Hard mode).", "timestamp_created": 1663044726, "timestamp_updated": 1663044726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122170191": {"recommendationid": "122170191", "author": {"steamid": "76561199122115936", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3405, "last_played": 1663233987}, "language": "english", "review": "love Ringo, great soundtrack, and the character dynamics are cool, honestly like the how they aren't just focused on that friendship bullshit. endings felt empty and void of emotion. and the soul matrix just sucks.", "timestamp_created": 1663043962, "timestamp_updated": 1663043962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508196711540222168", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122165215": {"recommendationid": "122165215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200366607", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 3855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3855, "last_played": 1663031906}, "language": "english", "review": "I make it no secret to the people around me that I'm absolutely a fangirl for ATLUS' Shin Megami Tensei series as a whole.

It doesn't quite have the depth of games like Persona 5, SMT 5, or Strange Journey, but it has a much more focused story. \n\nThe mainline SMT games are overly edgy alongside trying out new mechanics that generally don't always work (Smirk + Companion in SMT4), making it a good JRPG gameplay experience but not a strong character-driven experience. Side games like Strange Journey have excellent dungeon designs, but the story is often driven by assholes who won't ever compromise, always going to a \"the law/chaos ally goes to overwhelming extremes.\" \n\nPersona has been the series that often doesn't fall into those pitfalls by focusing on Social Links instead of Law/Chaos, but the gameplay is designed to often be unfocused, with a lot of your limited days going towards raising friendship points to attempt to get to the next breakpoint in a social link, and you often end up only experiencing a portion of the social links, which are the highlight of the character development. You effectively get familiar with the characters you already liked, and don't see the full story of ones you didn't, which can heavily impact your opinion of said characters.\n\nSoul hackers 2 stays focused on its relatively small cast of 5: Ringo, Figue, Arrow, Milady, and Saizo, plus a few characters that are close to that cast, about one or two characters per. They also have a few side characters with a short quest line that does help flesh out the problems with a technology driven world. You get a pretty good development on the group as a team, rather than just dating sim between mc and one other character. That's a big advantage of a focused story.\n\nNow the dungeons do suck. They're pretty barebones, and the game is low budget and that's noticable. The animations aren't super amazing either: Ringo's hair clips on her jacket from very early on and the soul hack dive animation is pretty clearly reused in a super noticable way. The demon roster isn't big and the Macca system is pretty fucked. Comp upgrades are a bit boring where there's much less tradeoffs than in other games (i.e. status weapon with 1 damage), and there's not as much flexiblity with each character as certain ones are locked to doing certain actions better than others. It streamlines it for newer players, but it also limits the depth of gameplay for older players. Sabbaths are boring and you can't have the animation on skip by default for some reason (?). They still haven't figured out that modern turn based combat should have a fast forward button like Bravely Default did, without tying it to auto-attack. They don't tell you what you need to do the True End. These are all valid complaints that don't necessarily need comparisons to just other SMT games. \n\nThe story also isn't the newest thing ever, but I think what a lot of people miss is that it's not about what the story is about, but what route the story takes to get to its plot points. I think you don't need to write a new story every game, just a relatable and meaningful experience on the path of the story. It's about how much you like the characters. After all, if we were rating SMT games by just the plot, most of them would be the same general story in the \"big picture.\"", "timestamp_created": 1662946107, "timestamp_updated": 1662946107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.55932849645614624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "122113284": {"recommendationid": "122113284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150010901", "num_games_owned": 402, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2060, "last_played": 1662930112}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun RPG with a nice battle system.

That being said, this game just doesn't feel complete. Not in the way of playability (bugs, glicthes, etc.), but more in a sense where it doesn't really have enough polish.\n\nI've played plenty of the other SMT games, so honestly I just bought this game because I'm waiting for P5R to release on Steam and I had already beaten P4G this year. With comparisons in mind, I really like the difference in combat in this game, the main difference being that attacking weaknesses won't stun enemies, but instead adds up to extra damage at the end of your turn, which itself can be modified in a bunch of different ways. As a result, getting hit is guaranteed, and it forces you to choose between offense and defense more than before. Other than that, its essentially the same, but for me, that was really just what I was looking for anyway. Upgrading weapons is a tad too grind-reliant, as it requires materials on top of the currency. All the options do allow for making more specialized builds with each character, but unfortunately they don't amount to much more than more damage for particular types, just first of the reasons why it doesn't feel like it had gotten the full polish treatment. \n\nAs far as plot and characters go, the game does a fine job. I actually really like the characters, as they really aren't as morally cut and dry as the other games, so seeing them interact with not only each other but with your dialogue options is a pretty fresh feeling. Ringo is genuinely really funny, and even if the other characters are kind of tropey, I thought it was not really distractedly so. The story is just okay, its main problem being far too predictable (and at the time of this review, I'm a little more than halfway through it). It feels more like a plot you would get when your in your second draft; you've got the basic premise, maybe some things to spice it up, but you haven't reached the point where anything truly engaging has been added. \n\nThe absolute BIGGEST problem with the game are the levels (or dungeons, whatever you might call them). Straight up, they are bad. Compared to other SMT games, they are incredibly uninspired, with them being simple mazes at best to infuriatingly gimmicky at its worst. They aren't even interesting on a aesthetic level either (other than the Soul Matrix, which acts as each companions side-quest dungeons). TWO of them are just subway systems with literally nothing going on. This was definitely the biggest problem with the game, and it is actually disruptive at time considering its not only the way to actually progress, but as mentioned before, they want you to actively grind for upgrades, too, so coming back to them is bound to happen. Even worse, for some reason you can't see the missions you accept in the Soul Matrix, so you either have to remember, look up what they were, or get lucky. The levels were CLEARLY not thought out enough, and its kind of baffling at times. \n\nAll in all, its a fine game, but its unfortunately marred by potential not seen through completely. The fact that the main story on average takes somewhere near 30 hours to finish compared to the near 100 the others have says a lot. In a weird yet disappointing way, Soul Hackers 2 feels like the side game to the side game, and while I would love for them to come back to this, they have to put in more effort.

Serious themes such as death, sexuality, and divinity are handled callously and the cutscenes depicting them are often slow and lifeless. \n\nThe environments are repetitive and boring, npcs and quests feel uninspired, and the dungeons don't feel worth exploring. Characters and demons themselves LOOK good, I just can't understand the gap between their looking straight out of Persona 5 while running around environments that look ripped from SMT 3 Nocturne.\n\nThe combat is worthwhile, but the Sabbath system feels gimmicky and the dialogue between characters makes me cringe. I would rather have a team of just demons over these gloomy losers. The leveling feels really off: unless you're stopping to fight every mob, you're going to be super under-leveled while progressing at an organic pace. \n\nThe Soul Matrix is straight-up a bad time. The side-quests feel like content for the sake of content, which I would expect from a lesser JRPG. It's like a checklist to clean out these horrible teammates' souls by witnessing their trauma and having a conversation like \"that was messed up but I see why you wanna get the bad guy\" over and over. It makes me more claustrophobic than Mementos from P5 or Tartarus from P3, and might stop me from ever finishing this game. \n\nLastly, a matter of personal preference: I usually play SMT games in Japanese, but the subtitles are really lacking in this one so I'm playing with the English dub so I understand what my loser teammates are whining about in battle.

Soul Hackers 2 is a strange mix of both. For new-new comers to the series, many of the changes may seem weird, but nothing annoying. For anyone else whose coming off the heels of SMTV/any other SMT game, they can put a real damper on your enjoyment.\n\nFor starters, you can't recruit demons via talking anymore, only through demon recon and it's random too. This means that 8/10 any time you recruit a demon it's one that you already have. With how rare demon recruit nords are, it's a MASSIVE waste of time. Even more so when you're trying to farm.\n\nFusion skills have also changed, now skills can only be passed down if the new demon has an affinity for it.  Which, the game does a poor job of telling. \n\nBut the biggest change is the (lack of) press turn, this changes battles on a fundamental level. In other games, you would avoid hitting a demon's resistance because it would mean losing you're extra turns. Now? It doesn't matter! Not only does hitting a demon's resistance not affect turns, it still does a good bit of damage. \n\nThankfully, the characters, music, and setting more than make up for all this.

Like I usually would have done, I cheesed it and level grinded my party to 99 early on, so I've been able to auto-battle most stuff. This was made easier by the fact that one of the DLCs lets you toggle the dropping of level-boosting items from each encounter, but I would have done the same thing even if it took me longer, so it was really just a timesaver. A friend who's also playing it has taken about the same amount of playtime to reach where I am now while barely using the DLC content, so I imagine it must not be that difficult of a game compared to mainline SMT.\n\nStory, and especially characters, are top-notch. I never want to play a silent SMT protag again after this. In contrast to Persona (except P2:EP), all the main cast are adults and have adult problems and deal with them in a mostly-adult manner. I played with the English dub, which was excellent, although I'm planning to do NG+ with Japenese audio to compare. The graphics are also excellent, in my personal, amateurish evaluation. The music - done by MONACA, the people who did the music for the Nier series and Drakengard 3 - is also great, aside from one or two tracks that I felt were repetitive. The weakest point is probably the mostly-optional side-dungeon design, which is very same-y.

It fits nicely into what I was looking for and my experience with the SMT series but I can see the caveats a lot of players have with it. so I think it's best served to just say who I think will enjoy this game. \n\nWho I think would enjoy this game: Soul Hackers 2 seems to be ATLAS targeting new adult fans of Persona. The story is less shy about treating you like an adult and all of the characters are adults themselves. So I think the person that is going to get the most out of this title are people looking for something a bit more mature than Persona 5 but are relatively new fans of the franchise. \n\nExplanation of scores:\nATLAS at this point has a reputation for love-able and memorable characters, and Soul Hackers 2 is no exception. The characters all have endearing chemistry and great well written banter that makes it easy to get attached. The most standout example of the characters and writing is our protagonist Ringo who is just as active and well, if not better, written a character as any other in the game, a notable and welcome departure from the silent and self-insert protagonists we see so often in RPGs in general. \n\nAesthetics wise Soul Hackers 2 delivers on what it offers. A bright and colorful cyberpunk world with a high quality soundtrack. The set pieces and aesthetics of the game are clean, well constructed, and have a memorable identity and flare. Meanwhile the soundtrack delivers on the style we're used to in the Persona franchise, albeit without the catchy vocal tracks. The only draw back for the looks and aesthetics of this game is the volume of aesthetics. Soul Hackers 2 shows its more limited budget in stretching the assets it has, however those same Assets are not wanting for quality.\n\nSoul Hackers 2 is a distinct flavor of the SMT franchise while also borrowing elements of the persona series specifically with it's social gameplay elements exploring side character stories. As far as SMT games go the combat is familiar and different enough that newcomers to the SMT style of games will find a distinct different flavor of combat vs recent entries such as Persona 5 but veterans of the SMT franchise may feel it doesn't stand out compared to other games from the series.", "timestamp_created": 1662498698, "timestamp_updated": 1662498698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497322112321853638", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121847384": {"recommendationid": "121847384", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252872254", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 3871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1003, "last_played": 1664770561}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game!\n\nBut ATLUS and SEGA are lazy to make it look good!", "timestamp_created": 1662489938, "timestamp_updated": 1668124591, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528036713600158691", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121844752": {"recommendationid": "121844752", "author": {"steamid": "76561199119120139", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 16995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 717, "last_played": 1665573367}, "language": "english", "review": "Having a a lot of fun with the game, [strike] but just can't recommend it because ATLUS and SEGA can't get their sh#t together.

The story and characters are pretty well done and I love how the the four main characters relationship evolves as the game plays out. The Bar Heidrun is a location you can go to to have \"hangout events\" with some of the squad and you can learn more about them as people and see them interact with each other on a more personal level (some times) outside of the main story. The game is quite easy actually (and I played on hard) as it's designed to make sure you don't really have to worry about dying and you can freely grind  for the levels and macca you need and honestly calling it \"grinding\" is a bit of a stretch as the game sort of throws exp at you. Battle System itself is simple and has enough mechanics to make it interesting but I wish certain elements were either still there or done better. Personally though I found that the battle system kind of dragged until mid close to late game phase when the demons became more interesting in their skill slots and having certain upgrades for your COMP and passives your characters can learn from the Soul Matrix. Dungeons are awful and boring as all hell (especially the Soul Matrix my god) and the lack of variety in regards to the dungeon music is a sin but the OST itself is good (well I like it at least). DO NOT BUY THE LOST NUMBERS DLC it's low effort and a scam tbh I didn't even finish nor do I really care to because it has what is the worst boss I fought in that game. The boss is bad not because of poor design but because there is a sheer lack of putting any effort in it's design to begin with and the main game has some interesting bosses.

If you've played other SMT games and are expecting something similar to those I would also not recommend it (DO MORE RESEARCH). For the truly brave that want something different (perhaps worse imo) then I think you could consider this game it just feels very unfinished to me. I have not played Soul Hackers 1, I played a bit of the remaster and it didn't really interest me so I do not know if it's a good successor to that game.\n\nJust for some background, I've played a bit of SMTIII Nocturne, finished SMTIVA, SMTV, Devil Survivor 1, Devil Survivor 2, the upgraded versions of those games as well, Persona 4 Golden, Persona 5, Persona 5R, Persona 5S and I am near the end of this game and I don't know if I can finish it. I consider myself in between a casual and hardcore for this genre at least the modern version.\n\nFor a modern game it feels really bad, more specifically unfinished. I'll try to not go into the specifics of the story, but most of the game play is mapping around the dungeon, fetch quest via talking to demons, and talking to your teammates. I struggled coming up with a third point cause it's mostly the first two. \n\nThe dungeon experience is straight out of Persona 4 or SMT4A but worse because they make you do more with the same movement and those games came out in 2008 and 2016 respectively. The puzzles in Soul Hackers 2 are just infuriating and inconvenient, the maps are plain, and walking around just feels like a chore. The movement and attacks also feel clunky, while it's not important in a game like this I thought I should point it. All this just screams to me that it was rushed because there is practically 0 depth to the dungeons.\n\nAnother issue I have with this game is the overworld. It feels so empty. It's pretty much the shops to get items, interact with teammates, demon fusion, quest shop, and restaurants for food. A lot of things are tied to character interactions which honestly they are all pretty bland.\n\nMoving on to the combat... it feels unrewarding. The press turn battle system has evolved into sabbath attacks which replace bonus turns for more damage at the end of your turn, which can be modified with different abilities but most of them suck imo. I feel like this is move is bad because it restricts a player's choice. It only allows you to get more damage down as opposed to healing or buffing yourself again which feels worse to me. It's not like this helps with resource management either because your MP pool is so big plus you can always just leave, heal, and come back.\n\nAnother issue for me personally is demon fusion. You are restricted to 6 skill slots with I think 0 amps for specific elements, although these come in the forms of augments for your comp which can be debated on whether this is good or bad. I think this discourages you from swapping demons too often as you only have so many augment slots and they are also linked to farmable materials + money. There are also far fewer elements in this game than say Persona or even SMT which means easier element coverage but also demon variety seems lower. Also money is painful to farm, I have the DLC and it's still rough fusing demons, so I couldn't imagine what it's like for people without.\nSide Note: RIP Hassou Tobi you will be missed\n\nAs someone else said in their review it's like a mix between a Persona game and SMT except it does both poorly.\n\nEnd of gameplay stuff\n\nPOTENTIAL SPOILERS MAINLY JUST TALKING ABOUT CHARACTERS AND HOW BAD THE STORY IS IGNORE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING \n\nCharacters:\n[spoiler]Most of the characters are bland. They are your classic tropes of serious muscle head, serious assassin girl, and playboy detective. The only saving graces for characters are like Ringo being fun and energetic, Yume for being cute, and Viktor for being interesting. Saizo, the character I thought I would hate the most, ended up being the best written out of the main cast and that's not saying much.[/spoiler]\nStory\n[spoiler]The story is as generic as it gets everything that happens can be seen a mile away in the most infuriating way. [/spoiler]\n\nSide Note/Rant (PROBABLY A SPOILER)\n[spoiler] FUCK RAVEN. FIGUE ALSO THREW SO HARD REPORT AND BAN PLEASE [/spoiler]\n\nIdk this was a rant cause I was really excited for this game, it looked cool like Persona 5, SMTV had some great combat imo, and I had an itch for a new SMT game and this just didn't scratch it at all. \n", "timestamp_created": 1662410744, "timestamp_updated": 1662410744, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591487884521484375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121795218": {"recommendationid": "121795218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036465332", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2412, "last_played": 1662416249}, "language": "english", "review": "There is a somewhat decent core of a game here, however I feel like the negatives outweigh the positives so I can't really recommend it.\n\nStarting with the battle system, I have to say that it's merely alright. It's the standard \"hit weakness, do more damage\" fare that you'd see in most other modern MegaTen games, but the press turn system is replaced by the pretty boring Sabbath mechanic that lets you do damage at the end of your turn depending on how many weakness you hit during it. Seems decent on paper, until you realize that it doesn't really do that much, and it's actually pretty useless against boss fights.\n\nThe COMP upgrade system is rather unimpressive, and all it does is encourage grinding enemies for the necessary materials to buy your upgrades. The upgrades themselves are also pretty boring, and the most exciting thing you can unlock is Commander Skills which are special abilities you can use every few turns in battle that do useful things for ya, like increase your Sabbath stacks, swap demons etc. Every other upgrade is generic \"do more damage\" or \"you can now equip higher tier upgrades\". Overall very underwhelming.\n\nThe story is very average and predictable. The characters are very barebones, and the ending is so basic you can see it coming 10 hours into the game. The first Soul Hackers game at least had great characters to carry the story, while this one doesn't even have that. There's really nothing special to write about here, the story is kinda just... there. \n\nThe side quests are on par with the main story, and kinda just exist. In a way they're worse than the main story, because you will often find yourself getting asked to go back to the same dungeon you were asked to go to 5 times already to fetch yet another item from yet another random demon. There's 2 particular dungeons, both of which are almost identical looking subway lines, that you are constantly asked to go back to over and over again because the game just doesn't have anywhere else to send you.\n\nFinally, what I think is the worst part of the game: the dungeon crawling. 80% of the action takes place in what's called the Soul Matrix, which is a set of 3 dungeons of 5 floors each, which are [i]extremely tedious[/i]. It's literally a series of almost untextured corridors floating in a void of nothing where you constantly get spammed by enemies every 2 steps of your way, and your reward for beating each floor is a tiny bit of story dialogue that they could've easily fit anywhere else. I think a good comparison to the Soul Matrix would be the final dungeon of SMT4 Apocalypse, for folks who have played that one. Just a large section of literal nothing that takes needlessly long to complete.\n\nI kinda focused on the bad here, but there [i]are[/i] things to enjoy here. The combat, despite being simple, is still fun. The boss encounters are mostly enjoyable. The fusion system is as fun as ever.\nUnfortunately, for every little good thing the game does it does 5 other things poorly, so it's just not worth the time.\n\nPlay Soul Hackers 1 instead, as this game has nothing to do with it anyways other than share a title.", "timestamp_created": 1662397575, "timestamp_updated": 1662397575, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.699174344539642334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121793502": {"recommendationid": "121793502", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974543571", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 24, "last_played": 1662343868}, "language": "english", "review": "I can see the appeal but I cannot recommend.  \n\nThis is if like Persona series was the highest quality drug in the world, but it ran out, but someone offers you a cut and watered down variant for the exact same price knowing many will still go down the rabbit hole.\n\nThe voice acting is - surprisingly good!

It has some flaws that just can't be overlooked, but overall it's a solid game. \n\nGameplay: This game does not feature the classic press turn system of the previous smt games, nor does it has a row system like the first soul hackers, instead you have a new system called: \"stack\" which allows you do basically an \"all out attack\" from persona 5 with the demons in your party. This damage is increased based on the amount of times you exploit a weakness. To be quite honest: this system is not that amazing at lower levels, but becomes a staple of combat when you're mid game. The format of dungeons that are in this game include some  classic smt warp puzzles, your Persona style  exploration, and unique demons on the field which I loved completely. Your DEMONS ACTUALLY HELP YOU EXPLORE! A sick mechanic that I hope they bring back in later installments. \n\nStory: I'm not going to break down the core synopsis of the story, what I will say is that this game does take things in such an interesting way. Taking all the previously niche and relatively simple concepts of the previous games and fleshing them out is a genius way of telling a new story in an old IP. So all in all, if you played the first game, or you like smt/persona in general, this story really ties together something for everyone to enjoy. The unique thing about this one is your choices do affect the outcome of each person's \u201csoul level\u201d. Which is a mechanic that ties into a place called the \u201csoul matrix\u201d. Think if Mementos from Persona 5 was individualized for your party members. The higher your soul matrix is with said party member, the more you can explore inside the soul matrix of that party member.  \n\nMy personal experience: Overall there were a couple things that really just make the experience and 8 rather than a 10 for a reason. You'll notice I have 89 hours on this game, the average playtime is 30-60. I typically like to grind, and I was playing on the hardest setting, this game is basically a cake walk on normal if you know what you're doing. The difficulty spike was fun and challenging at times, but here's where the problem comes in: Demons. Yes the core mech of this game is to summon and fuse demons right? Well there's a lack of a proper demon negation system, meaning if you see a demon in combat, you cannot recruit it like in normal megaten games. This was beyond disappointing to me at first, but the workaround is that your demons can recruit others for you. You just need to find them in the field.\n\n Let's talk about fusion: Idk if this was just me, but there was a huge lack of proper scaling when it comes to summoning demons at certain levels. For context: I was level 91 when I beat the game. From like 78-81 There are no demons you can fuse, meaning you better have built a proper party comp otherwise you will get clapped. This is a big problem that I think the developers might have oversighted when it came to properly balancing the game out as they have locked some demons behind Paid DLC that would have normally been behind in between some of the levels where there are gaps. I have to talk about this because this might very well make or break your playthroughs as I was at level 65 just stuck on a boss because I just did not have the right dps output with the demons I had currently in my party. Meaning I had to grind of course, but grinding to get semi-mediocre demons with a higher level wouldn't make much of a difference. The overall lack of new series demons is also Disappointing too when you realize the new jack frost Ai-Ho is a paid DLC, like seriously? \n\nLet's talk about DLC while on that subject: is it worth it? ABSOLUTELY NOT. To play devil advocate: I bought the lost numbers and the costume pack DLC (Because I like to hear the other games' music) The lost number dlc is a standalone story, meaning that it takes place between the game and is not something you're missing out on (Honestly it wasn't that great either of a story). It is also very disappointing and bad game design to include some of the best demons behind a paywall making this game virtually a pay to win situation for people who aren't as well versed in megaten titles trying to beat difficult bosses and such. This again is the problem I had with balancing issues when it came to demons and summoning them. \n\nSmall issue that is totally just my opinion: The lack of music. This is something I live for in megaten games. The composers just always do their things when it comes to new titles, I guess my expectations of this game come from SMTV just having such a banging soundtrack, when I realized it's the same dungeon crawling song for the entire game.. I was really disappointed, yea the boss music is cool, but the lack of ambience that this game has comes from a lack of a proper soundtrack. The first soul hackers had a different ost for each dungeon, I guess I was sorta expecting the same with this game. Although this may not sound like a huge deal for other players, it just dampens the overall feeling of the game. \n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for reading, if your planning on picking up the game after reading this, here are some basic tips I can recommend for you:\n\nFuse alot of demons, I mean fuse like crazy. \nHave each party member have a utility to perform (like saizo for ex, could be you wind guy)\nUpgrade you comp whenever you get a chance\nBalance the soul points between in each person (First playthrough and I maxed out the soul matrix)\nUse buffs and debuffs \nAlways keep at least 6-8 demons in your party at all times (good for stacks)\nIf you want to grind, get the udon ramen that allows you to encounter risky enemies and gives you a shield \nPhys/Gun Pierce is your best friend\n\nLastly: There are two possible endings\n\n\nTLDR: This game is a modern classic that does a good job of telling a compelling story, offers good gameplay, and brings in both modern and classic fans of the series. \n\nShould you play this game if you're new to the series? Yes, I believe this is a good starting point into the world of SMT. \n\nShould you play this game if you're a series vet? Absolutely, You'll notice right off the bat that there's tons of references and hints to other games loaded in this one that you'll come to appreciate. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this! 8/10 Solid \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1662392175, "timestamp_updated": 1662392175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121785098": {"recommendationid": "121785098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026816047", "num_games_owned": 363, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 776, "last_played": 1662387615}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been wanting to get into the SMT /Persona games.

Throw in some half-hearted MMO sidequests too - the game has to rely on this as a crutch to make the dull dungeon crawling more palatable. \n\nThe above would be digestible if the narrative was actually interesting, but it isn't. Soul Hackers presented the writers' bold 90s vision for what a connected future might mean for society. While I don't mind the loss of the hard boiled detective atmosphere that permeated its predecessor, Soul Hackers 2 is meant to be set in an era where data-driven AI has become sentient, but it does almost nothing interesting with it, at least in the 13 hours I've played so far. The world itself might as well be set in the present day. \n\nIf you're going to spend your precious time on an RPG, or even an Atlus game, you can do much better than this.

This review is my first impression after getting through the first 3 story dungeons.\n\nPlaying the game on Very Hard for my first playthrough and I'll say I'm enjoying the challenge it offers that restricts you from using items (although it is very trial and error not knowing any of the bosses the first time around) with just enough customization to help you prepare and enough side-content in between if you find yourself struggling/underleveled. Battle system is not press turn, but there's enough customization to compensate and make things a bit more interesting (equipment/comp upgrades/demon fusion/Mistiques that boost parameters of a certain type of move/etc). The characters are interesting and consist of adults that act like adults (elevated by the voice acting, the English VA's did a great job). The banter between the party members and the battles are probably the most enjoyable aspect of the game for me. Music is good overall.\n\nOnto the bad stuff, the dungeon crawling is incredibly bland and sluggish. I don't get why they had to tie many mechanics of dungeon crawling like finding item chests/heal spots/and especially demon negotiation to demon recon (where monsters in your stock just stand in random spots of the map to offer you one of the 3) it makes discovery/finding things a whole lot less interesting. Figue as a navigator seems really unnecessary with how simple encounters in this game work (the monster is 3 feet in front of me I don't need a navigator to tell me what's right in front of me) The Soul Matrix dungeon (of which there are 3 of the same dungeon for each of your party members aside from Ringo) is tedious/boring, it's like Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypses final dungeon times 3 with a lot of nothing and is a major missed opportunity. These things alone dampen the experience a pretty good amount and makes it kind of difficult to recommend to everyone kind of player.\n\nDespite being pretty mixed on this game and a little hard on it, I'm still finding enjoyment from the game. The cyberpunk setting and the battle system/characters are what help's this game stand out. I can only recommend it if you're craving something that isn't Persona or Shin Megami Tensei (though borrows things from both games), are looking for a JRPG with an adult cast, and are piqued by the cyberpunk setting/theme while not too peeved by the underwhelming dungeon crawling.", "timestamp_created": 1662270288, "timestamp_updated": 1662341369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121711745": {"recommendationid": "121711745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198970413095", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 787, "last_played": 1676416395}, "language": "english", "review": "---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2611 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2611 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2610 10\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1662260593, "timestamp_updated": 1662260593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508928596973419189", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121700053": {"recommendationid": "121700053", "author": {"steamid": "76561198842619484", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5133, "last_played": 1663011026}, "language": "english", "review": "I just wanna say before really starting that i've never really got a chance to play any of their other games like P5R on PS or SMT and im basically a newcomer to trying out Atlus games.\n\n(EDIT at the bottom of review)\n\nThe game is just fine. The characters are fine, I personally enjoyed their stories and their hangouts learning about them. The combat is fine, my problem with the combat is the \"Sabbaths\" the game does after every, single, time, you end your turn. After about 100+ battles I wish I could just turn it off. Its just annoying after a point, I don't care how flashy they look, they just extend how long my turn goes on for, when I just wanna grind some mobs and be done with it. you can skip them but you cannot actually just disable the cutscene for them because of abilities some demons can get. Having to mash the skip button just to skip the cutscene for it is really driving my gears.\n\nDungeons, my problem is the soul matrix. It is boring, I don't like exploring it. after doing the second instances of everyones Soul matrix for the first time and finding out there were 5 for each character not including Ringo (15) total with a shitty teleport system they introduce HEAVILY after the second one was so mind numbing. Unless you have a certain skill that you obtain from Milady which makes Ringo run faster while exploring dungeons your going to be looking at the soul matrix alot if you wanna get specific character skills. Other dungeons are fine, something else to look at.\n\nDLC, Please don't buy them unless your a crazed Atlus lover, I won't tell you how to spend your money but please just don't because I already blew mine on it just because I bought the pricier version of the game. \n\nThe booster item pack is bullshit, cheats locked behind a 7$ CAD price tag and it gives you guaranteed level up items for both your demons and your characters along with items that sell for a really good chunk of coin. The plus side of this is you can disable them dropping in the settings. Don't use them unless you wanna ruin the first playthrough of your game being overpowered.\n\nThe bonus story pack should have just been apart of the base game, I don't know why it isn't and its locked behind a garbage 13.49$ CAD for how little it adds to the actual game. the content itself is fine. The character it adds is a joy. It also gives you access to a dungeon locked behind the dlc, which consists of a 11F tower that is just a copy and past for all 11F's basically. Just run circles, get to the next stairs, repeat.\n\nThe bonus demons, same thing as the booster pack. essentially cheat codes locked behind a shit paywall of 17$ CAD.\nDemons with crazy good resistances and stats, along with really good moves. and they allow you to summon them regardless of your level so you could essentially start the game with a lvl 90 Demon if you wanted.\n\nCostumes & BGM pack, I enjoyed the music more then the actual costumes. The game only has one soundtrack for fighting basic fights not including bosses, the extra BGM at least spices up normal monotonous fighting if your grinding. The costumes are just ok. Definitely not worth 17$ CAD tho. Also can only see outfits in combat.\n\nUseful item set is free.  just adds a difficulty that limits your use of items in battle, and some early free stuff.\n\nIf you can get past the boring parts of the game its a alright game. the world is great. The dungeons are fine to explore, (other than matrix but to each their own) I recommend at least the base game. The DLC however I do not recommend buying. Ever.\n\nBonus - Loading screens take a long bit and there is a lot of them.

Turn based, and has elements from SMT and Persona. You do not need to play the first game to understand this one. It is a stand alone title. Worthy intro to Atlus games and will set new players up to how Atlus creates their games. Basic enough to understand and then moving into SMT and Persona, getting a much more refined experience from those titles.\n------------------------------------\nThis game is actually really good and a nice side project from Atlus. Newcomers to Atlus games should definitely give this game a try as it is about 1/3 in length compared to their mainline series of Persona and SMT and the mechanics are basic and unrefined in SH2 compared to the other titles. SH2 will take roughly 30-40hrs to complete vs their bigger titles which are upwards to 100hrs+. Vets of Atlus games should not be comparing this title to the bigger ones because it isn't a mainline series for them. Obviously it is going to be much more basic and comparing it to P5 is just being disingenuous and unfair to Atlus. The first ever turn based JRPG I played was (yes) P5 back in 2016 on PS4. It got me into this genre as turn based in not an easy mechanic that many players like due to how it slows down game play, atleast for me. But Atlus does it right somehow. So I know where some of the vet players are coming from when feeling the need to compare this title to it. Then went and played P4G and even FF10, but I haven't played an SMT game yet though.\n\nStarting off, the game runs very well and you can actually play it on release compared to other devs >_>\nThe story line is fully voiced and is fairly deep, though with sometimes feeling a bit rushed and cliche in JRPG tropes. But doesn't detract from the game all too much. The characters are unique and likeable, and you can build rapport with them to increase their personal story lines and get more background info. The game features various things from other Atlus titles, such as summons/compendium and upgrades/items for your team. The worlds are not the most detailed, but it gives off such a nice cyberpunk vibe and is detailed in an anime aspect. The music...Atlus scores another success in my personal opinion. My favorite, the over world exploration BGM, is calm and relaxing and I can see myself listening to it on a YT 10hr track lol. The dialogue is humour at times and brings a smile, especially that first boss, which had me face palming in both cringe and laughter. The bosses and enemies in early game are super easy. The game practically hand holds you until you get to where you get your 2nd team member. Then teh difficulty pushes you off the bridge and you will find yourself getting more challenged. Not so much in teh trash mob aspect, but teh bosses. They tend to exploit your weakness more by design and also pack a punch as well as can take a hit. I spent an hour trying to brute force my way through [redacted] in Subway Line 14 as I was too stubborn to go back and level up more before getting some nice RNG and beating the boss. After that, I made sure to prepare more. The game will crush you if you are under leveled, even by 1 or 2. So grinding may need to be required at times, which isn't too bad as the game is generous in handing out exp.\n\nNow for some of the negative things I've noticed which are actually not a whole lot, and that proves that devs can for the most part, release a polished game to the public and not play damage control. \n-The game has a weird brief auto walk after you stop moving for Ringo to come to a complete stop. It is annoying at times and should just be taken out of the game.\n-There are some minor rough edges on mainly the characters themselves when viewed up close in cutscenes. Nothing too drastic and for the most part, unnoticeable.\n-VERY minor stutters when moving around in the over world. lasts about 2-3 seconds. Infrequent enough to not warrant a negative feedback.\n\nLastly:\nThe default settings may need to be changed for some players, as they are super clunky and make the game feel much slower. \nConsider changing these settings when you get the chance:\n-Chat Speed to Instant (voice lines tend to finish before the text)\n-Camera Speed (turning the camera is super slow)\n-Camera Distance (Ringo defaults to taking up a good portion of the screen)\n-Camera Tracking to OFF (Allows you to actually control the camera more fluidly)\n-Using a controller (unfortunately, yes - M&K is perfectly fine, but feels clunky at times)\nAs well as any other settings to suit your needs.", "timestamp_created": 1662217665, "timestamp_updated": 1662217665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121676238": {"recommendationid": "121676238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198968557167", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3922, "last_played": 1664891426}, "language": "english", "review": "Another magnificent game from Atlus!!!\nI was really hyped for this game as it gave me persona vibe.\nThis game offered me everything I wanted.

Probably helps that the skits through the hangouts and meals give them so much more life.\n\nI think the story is better than most Atlus games, too.

The combat is good, though not as many tough battles as I'd like. The story so far isn't anything amazing, but the characters are all fleshed out enough that they can carry it.

And it's still very hard to forgive just how interminably boring the first 20-30 hours are.  \n\nDie-hard MegaTen fans will undoubtedly want to play this sooner or later, but if that's not you, go play one of the better games in the franchise instead.\n\n******************************************************\n\nMy disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.\n\nI know some of the Atlus fans out there are trying to put a good face on this, but the reality is that this is a mediocre MegaTen game *at best.*  I can even accept that the gameplay has been simplified to the point of being welcoming to newcomers, because I don't blame Atlus for wanting to bring in new players.  What I can't accept is how ungodly crushingly BORING this game has been so far.\n\nI'm 22 hours in, and - I'm not exaggerating - at least half of that time has been spent wandering around an endless, endless set of subway tunnels and utility corridors.  And every time I beat a boss and I think I'm finally done with this section, ANOTHER set of subway tunnels opens up.  It's like Mementos in P5, except so much worse because I don't even have the catbus to speed up exploration.  This is one of the most miserable grinds I've been put through since the PS2 days.  Just the same tunnels repeated over and over and over.\n\nAnd for funsies, occasionally I'm given a side quest which forces me to go back to other sections of this endless set of tunnels, for even more of the same. \n\nIt's like Atlus outsourced an SMT game to Idea Factory.\n\nLikewise, the plot has been dull as dishwater too.  It's been pretty much nothing except the characters sitting around talking about  the plot.  Apparently there's some big war going on between multiple factions of Demon Summoners, and an apocalypse is on the horizon, but I've been shown almost none of it.  Just endless cutscenes of the crew expositing at each other at the home base.  Nor are the characters particularly interesting either.  Main character Ringo has some sparks of personality, but otherwise, even the supposedly flamboyant outgoing character seems like he's on too much prozac.  \n\nAnd, of course, the combat being easy and streamlined just adds to the underwhelming.\n\nI really can't recommend it to anyone, not unless it magically gets so much better later on.   If you're already a MegaTen fan, you'll probably play it anyway - but don't get your hopes up.  If you aren't a MegaTen fan, just wait for Persona 5 Royale to hit Steam in a couple months.  It's so much better.

It was dungeon after dungeon without any breaks for proper character developments or subplots (excluding soul matrix and requests).  Character moments, while I did find them really enjoyable and heartwarming, were too short and too few.\n\nAs the main story is extremely rushed, there is no time or incentive to fully utilize items such as the augment/arcana mystiques because by the time you grinded enough to get them, you would already be reaching the end. \n\nCombat is okay.  I preferred the old press turn systems from older SMT games.  Delivers more of a challenge and a reason to fuse properly.  Without enemies being able to gain extra turns from exploiting ally weaknesses, there really is no point in stressing trying to get coverage because you can just heal the next turn.\n\nOn a technical level, the game runs smooth on my laptop, but I noticed that Ringo's hair tended to spaz out when she runs.  I've checked with many other users and they also said the same thing.  This isn't a major problem as some players did not have it happen to them.\n\nDungeon design is really disappointing.  For a \"cyberpunk\" world, the dungeons revolved around dark, gloomy, old installations.  Dungeons also have the same old puzzles most of you guys know such as, collecting keys to unlock doors, defeating mid-bosses to get items and teleporting through portals. Speaking about cyberpunk theme, despite the main city being designed nicely, you are unable to really explore the city.  When you're in the city, the game becomes a \"side scroller\" where you just run back and fourth to the store you want to visit, and that's all.  No exploration within the stores or whatever, it just shows up an item screen.\n\n\nThe soul matrix is really a slow burn, it does look good however.  If you aren't a fan of backtracking or running a long distance, you would probably find yourself skipping alot.\n\nDLC review:\n-Lost numbers is alright.  It's really just a few more quests.\n\n-DLC demons are alright.  They have unique skills, but you can't pass them on via fusion. \n\n-Costumes are beautiful, just that you can't wear them outside of battles.  Not even while traversing dungeons.\n\n-Stat boost items are sort of a waste because you can grind for highest stats, but once again if the main story is so short, what's the point?\n\nTo end the \"review\", I would just encourage future players to wait for sale to get this game, because it is not worth the SGD$120 I paid for.  The game has good moments, but the moments are quickly taken away due to how rushed everything is.  There were many promising character developments wasted.  \n\nMini spoiler:\nThe man you see in the trailers, only really appears for a few quick battles and that is all.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1661943767, "timestamp_updated": 1661943767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121513731": {"recommendationid": "121513731", "author": {"steamid": "76561199066440988", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2017, "last_played": 1663476822}, "language": "english", "review": "Ringo>>>>Joker", "timestamp_created": 1661935206, "timestamp_updated": 1661935206, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552492141723632813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121512130": {"recommendationid": "121512130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170334858", "num_games_owned": 534, "num_reviews": 100, "playtime_forever": 1298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1298, "last_played": 1662928751}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd somewhat recommend Soul Hackers 2, but with many caveats. I've played every single Persona game and almost every SMT game ever released. I've played games made by Atlus for a long time, and after the resoundingly high note that was SMT V, I had really, really high expectations for Soul Hackers 2. What I got was a very middling JRPG that's stuck between being an SMT game and a Persona game but is good at being neither. This game is a prime example of style over substance. It looks really, really nice. It has one of the best presentation out of any megaten game. However, the gameplay, dungeons, and quality of life aspects just aren't there. \n\nPros:\n-Great artstyle. Everything just looks very aesthetically pleasing, from the characters to the environments, the demons, the visual effects, etc... The colors really pop and look vibrant no matter what is happening on screen. The character models are not only very sharp and expressive, but they also move really well. From a presentation perspective, I can't fault Soul Hackers 2 at all. It just looks really good.\n\n-Interesting story with solid characters. Midway through the game, the only thing that pushed me forward was the story. It shared some loose connections with the original Devil Summoner and Soul Hackers that I appreciated, and it was nostalgic to see the world of these games again after so long.\n\n-Great atmosphere and setting. The writers really kept the atmosphere of the original Devil Summoner games alive in this game, portraying this gritty, dangerous world full of demons and intrigue. Again, this may be because I've played the original Devil Summoner and Soul Hacker games, but I instantly liked the world of Soul Hackers 2. \n\n-I like Ringo a lot. \n\nCons:\n-The gameplay is noticeably worse than the most recent Atlus entires. It's like we've regressed 10 years since Persona 5 and Shin Megami Tensei 5 came out. This game feels like a PS2-era game that was released in 2022. Gone are press turns or anything that makes megaten combat remotely enjoyable post-nocturne. The combat in this game trying to be more like Persona's combat but it's somehow much slower paced, less complex, and less satisfying. It plays like a very generic JRPG combat system, which is already a dealbreaker for me when it comes to JRPGs, but even more so when it's a megaten game. In addition, demon negotiation has been completely gutted. You can no longer even talk to demons in battles. The only way to recruit them now is through an RNG mechanic that occurs when roaming the dungeon, and when you do get to talk to them they ask you for only one thing and will always join you if you give it to them. It's like they only included demon negotiation for the sake of having it, and only put in only the minimum amount of effort to make it functional. It's a very gimped version of a very long-standing megaten mechanic, and I have no idea why they made it this way when even games released 10 years ago had it down pat. \n\n-The dungeon crawling is really, really tedious. Ringo moves really, really fucking slowly and the dungeons mostly consist of very barebones corridors that you run straight down to get to the next boss or story moment. There are barely any gimmicks or variations in scenery. These are some of the laziest, most tedious \"\"\"\"\"\"dungeons\"\"\"\"\" I've seen Atlus put out. Hell, even Megami Tensei I and II on the goddamn NES had some dungeons with more variety than Soul Hackers 2. The game also only has 2 tracks that it reuses for every dungeon in the game. 2 tracks. You remember how each dungeon from any Persona game, or even each dungeon from the first Soul Hackers game had a unique theme? None of that is here. In fact, the dungeon music in this game became so mind-numbing after 20 hours in that I just turned the music off and played my own music. I almost dropped this game a few times because of how unbelievably ass the dungeons were. All my above complaints wouldn't even be so bad if only Ringo had a sprint button that I could use to speed through it all, but they decided to make her jog like my grandma after she just had a stroke. After having played through the sprawling maps of SMT V or the complex, multi-layered dungeons of Persona 5, it's really, really hard to slog through this game's sorry excuses for dungeons.\n\n-The loading screens are atrocious. You get a 5 second loading screen every time you change locations. It may not sound much but keep in mind that this happens every. single. time. you. change. locations. If you need to go shopping at 3 different stores, go grab some quests from the quest lady, then go fuse some demons, then go back to base to rest up, then go back to the dungeon to keep exploring, that's 7 loading screens in the span of 5 minutes. How is this even a thing? SMT V had massive open levels that were like 30 times the size of any one map in Soul Hackers 2, and there were barely any loading screens at all in that game. \n\nConclusion: \nI'll give Soul Hackers 2 a 6/10, and I'm being generous. I wanted to like this game. I liked its presentation, its world and story, but if you strip away all those things, it's a very clumsy and mediocre JRPG sitting on the shoulders of giants. It's not even sitting properly up there; it's just half-heartedly dangling one leg off the side like it doesn't fully know what it's doing. My main problem with this game isn't that it's not Persona 6 or SMT 6, but rather, it executes some of the most basic aspects of being an Atlus game quite poorly. I'd only recommend you get it when it's on sale or if you're a big fan of Atlus and their games. Even then, set your expectations somewhere around the middle of the pack. Then you'll enjoy this game much more than I did.\n\nEDIT: After I've finished the game and sat on it for a while, I'll knock the score down to a 5. The story was actually quite good right up until the very end, where it went straight to shit. The final dungeon was also like a final fuck you to the player. The enemies suddenly got a massive level spike, forcing you to go back and grind, and the \"\"\"\"\"gimmicks\"\"\"\"\" that they threw in were, as with any other gimmicks in this game, thrown in for the sake of having gimmicks and padding the dungeon out rather than being a fun or interesting challenge. The DLC mission is also a joke. It's one of the most barebones Atlus DLC I've ever played. SMTIV Apocalypse and SMTV had some of the coolest DLC the franchise has ever seen, so Soul Hackers 2 once again is the lame child in Atlus' family of games.", "timestamp_created": 1661932026, "timestamp_updated": 1665607677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900355339050292969", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121511042": {"recommendationid": "121511042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058601567", "num_games_owned": 888, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 8594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8216, "last_played": 1662841258}, "language": "english", "review": "The game's alright, but, I strongly recommend to buy it with a heavy discount.

It looks like a sharper version of that game with some cool cyberpunk flair nothing too fancy but its still pretty. (This is an HD switch game imo). Game supports ultrawide which is nice the character designs and art are awesome imo.\n\nStory was a pretty fun ride for me, I was recently playing Death Stranding and the story kinda shares similar man vs a.i issues. If you played Nier or something similar you get the idea for this games general story which i personally enjoy. Dialog was good with the plot dancing around goofy and serious things. Acting was great (played with JP VO) all I gotta say about that is \"Mu,mu,mu-mu-mu-mu\". \n\nI saw alot of people saying this is missing x or y features, not enough to do with the party members etc. This is Soul Hackers not persona guys. That said its hyper focused story, demons, dungeons and I think it fills a nice spot in Atlus current lineup. SMTV having semi open world* with enemy patrols, traversal and exploration, Persona with its more indepth social and sim features. And now Soul Hackers with its focused story and dungeons, its a good time as always building up ur roster of demonic pokemon.\n\nFor sound the opening OST kills it imo, def a jammer not many memorable tracks in this one. The last boss track gives me Nier vibes and is pretty epic. I do still enjoy the break in the battle music even now so yeah like always Atlus battle BGM is good.\n\nOverall Id recommend this, Best to try the game urself if only the price of admission wasent so high GL.\n\n\n(Possible Spoilers MY THEORY ON WHY THIS IS ON A TIMELINE AFTER THE EVENTS and INFLUENCE OF PERSONA5 /STRIKERS with possible ties to PERSONA 4?\n(*WARNING* STOP READING IF UR WORRIED ABOUT SPOILERS KEEP READING IF U LIKE LORE AND COMPLETED THE GAME)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anyone here's played persona 5, you may be interested in this. (who am I kidding lol) \n\nYou eventually encounter a dungeon helper that looks strikingly similar to one very popular cat. From color layout to eyes and even ear style and placement, that got me thinking could it be? No way. \n\nAnother member of the party carries himself very similar to Yuuske wearing white with the hair covering his eye and dons a fox tail pattern scarf.\n\nBasically if you play this game u will encounter 1 too many coincidences for them to be coincidences. There's a group of people called \"The phantom society\" and the leader wears a mask and touts fighting for good.\n\nThe game asks you whats the difference between humans, demons and a.i. Which makes me think back to P4 where Adachi turns into an Aion esc contruct (complete with rainbow style LEDs implying he has control over all colors of covenants in his world / server? I think no one in this game is \"human\", because even devil summoners when damaged break apart into shapes.\n\nAnd the baby cocoons also bear resemblance to things we've seen in other atlus titles I think SMT nocturne (not sure been a min). With the last boss sharing similar shape to those \"babies\" in the pods u see in the bone zone.\n\nThis game is an altered server / timeline sometime after the influence of the events in persona5's world / server is what I'm coming up with after 1st clear with nearly all side quests complete outside of DLC.\n\nGunna take sometime before I jump back into to NG+ and see if they hid anything, was one long enjoyable ride.", "timestamp_created": 1661906915, "timestamp_updated": 1661987270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567791521549224854", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121495799": {"recommendationid": "121495799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155528981", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1171, "last_played": 1667539365}, "language": "english", "review": "@Atlus\n\nPlease give us more protagonists that talk.

Set classes in IV with rigid party structure, back to the freeform classes of the Onion Knights in V, magic decoupled from characters first in magicite, then materia in VI and VII? That was, for me, an exciting time. Who knows what Square will do next? (Oh, Junctions. Oh well, IX will do something different!)\n\nThis feels like that for Atlus, who have a habit of most of their games, really since the 90's, feeling kinda samey. Shin Megami Tensei will be apocalytpic explorathons (since V nixed dungeons mostly), Persona will be social sim with decent dungeon and a fun, dumbed down version of SMT's press turn. Catherine will be...  weird. Etrian Odyssey will be boring (sorry, guys), Trauma Center will be impossible to play in docked mode, and 13 Sentinels will be... developed by Vanillaware and just distributed by Atlus. (but seriously, play 13 Sentinels, guys)\n\nSince the one-two punch of Persona 3 and SMT Nocturne brought us One-More! and Press Turn, Atlus combat has mostly looked like variations on those. Which is fine. They're great. And every time they deviate from that in ostensibly a game in those series (Strange Journey's Demon Co-Op, TMS's Encores, and now Soul Hackers' Sabbaths), there's an outcry.\n\nSo I'm going to be that weirdo who says I like Sabbaths. I don't think they're better than Press Turn (SMTV still has my favorite moment-to-moment combat from an Atlus game), but it's nice to see something different in an interesting way. It's less braindead than Encore and feels more satisfying along the lines of Demon Co-Op, especially as things get more complex later in the game (once you get 10+stack Sabbaths things are typically more interesting). And the way systems are spread out, between Mystiques, weapon upgrades, Soul Matrices, and demons, there's enough fun interlocking stuff to keep things interesting, and I can definitely see new game + being worth doing.\n\nThe story is simple, straightforward, almost basic at times, but I haven't yet been absolutely insulted by it. What it mostly allows is for character interactions, which is the real bread-and-butter of the storytelling here, and which keeps me interested in what's happening. Grabbing a drink at the bar, sharing a meal at the safehouse, or digging into their secret, repressed traumatic memories are all opportunities to get to know these cast members and really feel like a part of the group. Even your navigator, Figue, and incidental side characters like Raven have piqued my interest enough that I pay attention to new info about them. Having onging questlines involving the shopkeepers is also a great idea, as it gives these potentially throwaway NPC's some staying power as characters (think the collector manikin from Nocturne). The world has stuff going on. It's a cyberpunk world, so a lot of what goes on really sucks. And it's glorious.\n\nThe real let-down for me is dungeon design. If you count the three soul matrices as a single dungeon, since they all share a tileset, and the two subway lines as two different dungeons... which also share a tileset, there hasn't been much variety in dungeon designs. I'm not done yet, but I feel about 2/3 of the way through, and repetitive dungeons have taken up much of that time. Once I'm IN combat, or out of the dungeon, things are great, but wandering the hallways is a drab, repetitive, boring experience made somewhat worse by the semi-random placement of scouting demons (which replace item chests, healing points, and also allow you to recruit demons).\n\nOverall, the game is very fun, and despite its flaws, I definitely recommend it. Unless you're a real diehard fan of the sort of bright cyberpunk that feels like it's trying way too hard to bury its dystopia (but trust me, it's there), it may be worth waiting for a sale, especially given the absolutely predatory practices regarding DLC, but I am glad I preordered the game proper, if nothing else to let Atlus know that yes, some of us are interested in PC releases of their products.", "timestamp_created": 1661822647, "timestamp_updated": 1661822647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121448655": {"recommendationid": "121448655", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978323276", "num_games_owned": 476, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 427, "last_played": 1662682059}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game with a good story.

I like the traditional press turn system, which has unfortunately been replaced with the sabbath system. In a nutshell, for people familiar with Persona and SMT: Instead of getting extra (half) turns for exploiting weaknesses, the party collects \"stacks\", one per exploited weakness, later more possibly with some passive skills. If there is at least one stack at turn end, it will trigger sabbath, which is essentially an \"All-out\" attack, and it gets stronger the more stacks there are. This actually makes the game easier in a way, but it just feels a little less satisfying to me.

The gameplay itself was enjoyable at first, I was playing at hard mode for 20 hours or so but then I decided to go back to normal because how they treat some boss fight, especially some optional boss challenges. Some optional boss challenges have mechanics where they will one shot you after X turns, which is extremely frustrating if you face them under levelled. Pretty much every boss, you will need at least 1 heal bots and sometimes they get rid of 1 character on optional bosses, I find it almost impossible to beat boss on first try (unless you are over levelled) which is usually what I've always aim to do when playing Persona.\n\nAnother incredibly frustrating things are economy in this game, I've been going through dungeons facing almost every single one enemy that I encountered and I only have barely enough for one or two accessories and upgrades leaving none to summon devils. On top of that, the price for summoning devils are ridiculous reaching up to 300k at level 20-ish, the more you levelled them up, the more severe the price hike gets. You can either choose to get a couple of weapon upgrades or one devil summon, I would always choose to upgrade my weapon because devil always ends up getting fused anyway.\n\nDungeons are also very uninspiring, it's closer to what we had in Persona 3 and Persona 4 where dungeons are pretty much almost the same and I think we can also compare it to Mementors in Persona 5. I would imagine this as playing Persona 5 without the main dungeon, only going through mementos and the area is significantly larger without much challenges.

There's not much to set it apart from any other title in the franchise, and while it does do everything somewhat competently, it doesn't do anything particularly outstanding. \n\nThe sabbath mechanic is similar to demon co-op from strange journey, map navigation is similar to Tokyo Mirage Sessions, you control humans with demons attached like in Persona, it has a set of dungeons similar to Mementos in Persona 5 that I literally thought were randomly generated because of how boring and samey their aesthetic was. The most unique thing about Soul Hackers 2 is the story which is fine? I do really like the characters but for whatever reason the overarching narrative just wasn't that gripping to me. At around 40 hours long this game is one of the shorter games in the megaten franchise that I've played.\n\nMy three main gripes with the game are the Soul Matrix, the character voice lines and the DLC.\n\nAs I said before the Soul Matrix dungeons are literally identical to one another and they are astoundingly boring. There's a billion side missions to do in here so that you keep trudging around the same endless gray platforms for hours. The game's skill unlocks are also partially tied to it. If you want to be more effective in combat and get cool skills, you MUST do this dungeon regularly. \n\nI can't exaggerate how ludicrous the character voice line play rate is. The navigator will tell you every single time that an enemy has appeared \"An enemy!,\" that they're running at you \"Be careful!.\" and that you're safe after you hit them \"Now we can relax.\" It happens EVERY SINGLE TIME. Once you get into a battle the fun doesn't end, because nearly every action you take or button you press in the battle screen will trigger a voice line. Sometimes multiple characters saying lines on top of each other! For me, using the menu in a quick and efficient way is one of the most satisfying parts of a JRPG, and it really gets on your nerves constantly hearing voice lines play. It was so egregious that I actually just muted voices altogether a couple hours into the game. If you can have fun without voice acting and let the music carry battles and scenes, then I highly reccommend playing this way as well unless you can somehow withstand the barrage of voices telling you what to do.\n\nThe last thing I want to touch on is the day 1 dlc for this game. Fuck you Atlus. The dlc issues that plague this company are downright insulting. SMT V had a superboss and iconic demons locked behind dlc, and Soul Hackers 2 has extra story and dungeon content PLUS demons, seemingly picked at random, also locked behind a paywall. If you decide to buy this game, don't buy the DLC. Please don't support this anti-consumer bullshit.\n\nPutting that aside, overall Soul Hackers 2 is a very okay game. It could have literally any other name and still be a good Atlus JRPG, but for some reason they went with the soul hackers branding. If you have played basically every other megaten game then pick this up and you'll probably enjoy it, but the rest of Atlus's catalogue far exceeds Soul Hackers 2.", "timestamp_created": 1661745476, "timestamp_updated": 1666664505, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121405689": {"recommendationid": "121405689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009633116", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 169, "last_played": 1662404660}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was marketed like a triple A game, which must explain why there's $40 of DLC on day 1, including story content that should have been in the base game, and a costume/BGM DLC that seems to work for only a fraction of the playerbase (and is somehow more expensive than the story DLC). \n\nI have a lot of other issues with this game which I won't go into.

I am recommending this as a game on its own and not the major issues surrounding its release trust me I will tell you how stupid it is. Here is the quick version of what I want to say. Maybe I'll add more to this later but I got shit to do and so do you.   \n\n-Soul Hackers 2 is an absolute must play if and only if you are a fan of Megaten games there is subtle and not so subtle fan service to the og Soul hackers and devil summoners \n\n-If you aren't super involved and interested in the franchise some mechanics will take you a minute to fully grasp (as a Megaten game it is easy, as a normal turn based JRPG it's probably around average to a little above average in terms of difficulty)\n\n-if you have only ever played a persona game please please PLEASE temper your expectations. This is not persona the scope of this game isn't and wasn't ever meant to be on the same level of persona. (hence why its dumb to price it as such from a PR perspective)  \n\n-it\u2019s a 7.5/10\n\n-story is good, combat is great, OST character design and art style is orgasmic\n\n-dungeons don\u2019t have a whole lot of window dressing much in the same vein of a classic Megaten game. The star of the show is what you're doing, not where you are doing it. there isn't a whole lot going on in the dungeons themselves. enemies are frequent and will always be riding you\n\nNow unrelated to the game but the issues surrounding its release.\n\n-ATLUS fumbled the bag with the collectors edition of this release through Shop ATLUS. fact of the matter is a lot of us never got a chance but it honestly is a blessing in disguise \n\n-Day one DLC for a triple A priced game that isn\u2019t supposed to be on the same scope of one of their major titles such as SMT V or P5R is total bullshit and is on par for ATLUS as many of us should know by now. \n\n-this game should not be priced at $60 in any universe if you want my opinion on what this should be priced at. $40 for a standard edition $50 maybe $60 if you really have to have the Day one DLC\n\nThe day one DLC itself is nothing special. The items are helpful for busting out grinding but should honestly be free. The demons are very nice. Overpriced at $12.99 but nice, the models  for them are wonderful and they are all packaged as one. I would have no complaints (especially because ATLUS tends to package extra demons like this) except for the fact Namissa is locked behind the paywall. Someone who should already be a character we interact with in the story anyways and could've been someone we battle to recruit I.E Demi fiend and Ruido/Dante style, that's when they bust out the OG soul hackers battle music could've been fuckin sick. Speaking of music we have the worst offender. The music and costume pack, $12.99 holy shit batman! The music is enjoyable and the costumes look nice but $12.99? I was born at night, not last night. The lost numbers is supposedly Inconsequential to the story which is probably more of a good thing I mean, you'd be pissed if important plot related details were locked behind a $10 paywall  \n\nOverall the Day one DLC sucks but ATLUS is a business and the winning faction inside the company right now is on the side of \u201cmake the most amount of money\u201d and they know they can get away with it \n\n-edit #1- \n\nATLUS has further fumbled the bag even more with breaking the DLC if you happened to get it through a 3rd party key seller in some cases. I don\u2019t have this issue because I bought the $90 version but the issue needs to be addressed and also reflected upon in this section of my review until such a time passes where ATLUS resolves the issue. \n\n-end of edit #1-\n\nIf you are gonna refund and wait for it to get cheaper I wouldn't count on it getting super low %15 off max knowing how reluctant ATLUS is to push it super low.", "timestamp_created": 1661731653, "timestamp_updated": 1661862355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121396708": {"recommendationid": "121396708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038355673", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 381, "last_played": 1662840156}, "language": "english", "review": "I like apples.", "timestamp_created": 1661728071, "timestamp_updated": 1661728071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463547557592391968", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121394174": {"recommendationid": "121394174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344927714", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1030, "last_played": 1662343812}, "language": "english", "review": "if persona and smt had a low budget b*stard child. the battle system is better in smt and the party interactions are better in persona. avoid this and just play the superior smt 5 or persona 5.", "timestamp_created": 1661723735, "timestamp_updated": 1661726473, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.371690064668655396", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121393367": {"recommendationid": "121393367", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983845460", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 4311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1180, "last_played": 1662522506}, "language": "english", "review": "Plays like Atlus, feels like Atlus, sounds like Atlus, looks like Atlus.

A quick and short answer for me is \"Buy if it's on sale and you're interested\".\n\nIn personal opinion the story and characters are very solid and well-built. They don't ever feel like an annoyance nor make me want to roll my eyes, which was something i was terrified was going to happen pre-launch. \nThe combat in this game is an altered form of SMT's typical combat: Instead of the staple \"Press Turn\" fighting, it's instead normal turn-based with the added element of \"Sabbaths\", which is a large attack based on the accumulated Stacks you got from exploiting weaknesses. The system itself feels very one-sided and unfair, which made this game typically easy even in hard mode. It would be slightly better if the opponents could do the same, at the very least the summoner bosses, but none do that as it's a plot element that Ringo is the only one who can. It can be exploited even more as you delve farther into the Soul Matrix's of each character as you get Stack bonuses too. \nRecruitment is also something different, as there isn't talking options during battles; instead, you recruit them in the field from your other demons finding them. I think this system is ok in all honesty: it's incredibly easy to recruit them in this game, as almost all of them only need a singular item to be completely fine with joining. \nThe music was honestly very good throughout the game, however there isn't many tracks in it(which is probably why they have a music dlc in the first place). For the most part you should be expecting to hear the same few songs alot.\nDungeons in this game are very straightforward and sometimes incredibly annoying once you reach the third floors and beyond for Soul Matrix's. Something to note as well is that there's no treasure boxes in this game, you only find items from your demons.\nQuests can be very binary in which it's basically either just a slaying mission or a collecting one.\nA complaint i can also quickly think of is how animations can look very stiff and unnatural.\n\nDespite a lot of the flaws this game is presented with, i still thoroughly enjoyed it throughout the duration i played. It definitely feels like they needed to at least delay it a bit more to sharpen the edges it has, but it is what it is. The game gave me alot of similar charm to the original SH which made me really happy too.

Story and characters are interesting, voice-acting is great, art direction is cool, but the gameplay is too thin and a step back from more recent SMT games. Taking away the extra turns from hitting weaknesses and replacing it with the Sabbath system has dumbed down the strategy greatly. It's just hit weaknesses, get free damage at end of turn, repeat. Add to that the limited move list for every demon, little variation in enemy encounters, and it just feels like a mobile game; a far cry from the strategy and careful balancing in the core SMT or Persona games. Beyond that there are the side quests, which are MMO-style fetch or kill affairs. Boring, uninteresting slogs, every single one. Under-cooked is the term that came to mind. Occasionally a dungeon will spawn an elite or treasure enemy, which are basically pointless because the elite enemies are just regular demons that are 5+ levels higher than the party and the treasure monsters were regular demons that you can't fucking hit no matter how much you buff your aim. To top this off there are strange quality of life issues. When moving around town protagonist Ringo will take a few slow-down steps after the player releases the stick like she just sprinted the hundred meters. Navigating to the world map can not be cancelled, a selection must be made, and from there a load screen. And the load times for a game that has smaller maps and poorer graphics than SMT5 on the Switch are longer than they really should be.

I'll post another review once I've beaten the game, but since I'm a good while in I wanna get my thoughts out.\n\nFirst off, Atlus' DLC practices are absolutely abysmal. Day 1 DLC is nothing new for them, and it is (mostly) cosmetics, but an entire story expansion behind a paywall right out the gate is just insulting. I bought the Deluxe Edition, and I felt incredibly guilty for doing so, as it felt like validating and supporting these practices. This isn't part of the game itself, but I felt I should mention it.\n\nUnlike many other people, I'm not a big fan of the combat system. I mean, it's fine, it's functional, but it doesn't have the same rhythm that SMT usually has, due to lacking any real form of a Press Turn system (Sabbaths hardly count, they don't actually add turns and it's just \"do more damage unga bunga\"). It feels more like a standard JRPG, which may be fine to some but I believe it's very lackluster for SMT. I feel like the difficulty options also need work; I've been playing on Very Hard, which doesn't really add anything to the combat, it just locks off an option and calls that difficulty. \n\nThe dungeon crawling is also kind of a drag. All the dungeons (so far) have just been hallways with no real interesting features or gimmicks. There's not even any awful gimmicks to gripe about in any of the dungeons yet (the Karma Temple from DDS1 might've been one of the worst things I've ever had to experience but at least it's memorable!). \n\nThis game's saving grace is its characters. All of the characters have incredibly unique designs that stand out, and they're all incredibly memorable. The story they're used in could use some work, but they're honestly the only reason I have stuck with this game for as long as I have.\n\nTL;DR, this game is a decent JRPG but a bad SMT. It's a decent entry point for newcomers, but I cannot recommend it at full price.

Though unrelated to the previous game the world very much is the same world though we don't really address alot of the politica in SH1 that was setup in the World, Basically an Almighty AI calculated the world would end if 2 specific people are killed, your mission is to prevent their deaths and save the world. You end up being too late and have to Soul Hack Arrow to bring him back to life and from their you go on a Steel Ball Run chase to collect the corpse parts.....I mean to collect the Covenants to prevent the Antagonist from collecting all 5 and using them to summon the Great One and end the world.\n\nGraphics: 3.5\nVery basic Anime JRPG graphics of the 2020s the game offers very little customization and the antialiasing is kind of poor. (I run a 3060 GeForce RTX, with a Ryzen 7 5800x and 64GB of Ram) while i get a real stable 144+ FPS without needing vsync the lack of additional options makes me feel less in control of how the game looks.\n\nAudio: 4\nOST is pretty good, if you got the DLC though the new soundtracks added are alright (kinda sad I can't blast Mass Destruction during battle) also if you get the DLC unless Persona 5 or P5R you get to select the BGM during battle in gameplay settings and don't have to rely on what outfit Ringo has equipped.\n\nDLC: 1\nThe day 1 DLC that has everyone in a fritz is honestly utterly optional the only major concerning one is the  Number's Chaser which adds a Side Story for you to progress side by side with the main story and due to Atlus' habit of Royal/Gold/FES editions not including DLC you will more than likely have to rebuy this DLC when this gets the Rerelease (if they even rerelease it considering the backlash they are unnecessarily getting.) The biggest reason i'm ranking it so low is you can tell all of it is just content that was not complete at the game going gold deadline and they had this content almost done so they decided to finish it between the Going Gold time and Release time to give us Day 1 DLC. The reason i strongly believe this is 2 series signature Demons/Personas are in the day 1 DLC Satan and Mara, the 2 have been in every base game to my recollection of an SMT title (outside of Digital Devil Saga) to date.\n\n\n\nUpdated notes: Game is Persona 5 levels of easy and it is surprising a short campaign based on where I'm getting bored, the mystery and conclusion just doesn't feel great. While I enjoy returning to a standard story and gameplay for SMT, this is definitely leaving much to be desired, would recommend getting on discount as a bundle.", "timestamp_created": 1661697454,

Even if it wasn't up to par with P5 or SMTV, I still wanted it to perform well enough so we could get more spin-offs. However, it saddens me to say that Soul Hackers 2 feels like a game that predates P4 or any modern ATLUS title. The game has so many questionable design choices in the name of streamlining that it's no longer fun. For a game called Soul Hackers, very Little soul can be found in its dungeons and levels. I never went in expecting a meticulously designed game packed with content like P5, but I expected something that would make it stand out. So far, I haven't been able to find it, and I doubt I will ever be.\n\nI cannot recommend Soul Hackers 2.", "timestamp_created": 1661635824, "timestamp_updated": 1661641367, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577599406242370605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121338862": {"recommendationid": "121338862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073328555", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 109, "last_played": 1666889536}, "language": "english", "review": "Ringo is hot, nuff said", "timestamp_created": 1661635391, "timestamp_updated": 1661635391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510968029499053955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121338632": {"recommendationid": "121338632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041814337", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 622, "last_played": 1672642568}, "language": "english", "review": "ringo hot :3", "timestamp_created": 1661635049, "timestamp_updated": 1661635049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497770905494689941", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121337750": {"recommendationid": "121337750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402147937", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 343, "last_played": 1663499677}, "language": "english", "review": "5 hrs in.

The enemies do not get this feature, but can still ambush you, which is a legitimate possibility based off of their spawning patterns.\nThe dungeon system works pretty well, with your demons popping up around the map for a chat and a quick mid-dungeon recovery or gift, and the sword swing letting you knock down map enemies without starting a fight unless you intentionally run into them afterwards in case you just want to keep moving. This game also has \"high risk\" enemies (sort of like persona Q's FOEs), that cannot be knocked down, but can still be pushed away if you want to run past them.\nThe bonuses for leveling a demon enough to learn all of their skills provide a nice little pseudo 'job' system, and I'm curious to see where this system goes later in the game.\n\nNon gameplay things: Pretty art, enjoyable characters, solid music. Animated portraits in dialogue is a nice touch. English voice acting is pretty good, though there's a kind of disconnect in RIngo's voice acting outside and inside of battle.

Right after the prologue, Ringo would automatically thrown to a dungeon in order to start her mission of saving the world from the apocalypse. The goal is to save a certain someone whom later joined in on her party, Arrow.\n\nMeeting Arrow would give the player the mechanics of the 'Soul Hack'\u30fcWhich is a skill unique to Ringo where she could 'hack' a soul in order to revive them from death. Once Ringo saved Arrow, it was then revealed Arrow had a connection to the other characters that later became the rest of the party members. This would all be done in just [b]less than four hours.[/b]\nIt is unbelievably fast if compared to Persona series in general.\n\n[h1]Character Dynamics[/h1]\nSo far, I don't really see the appeal of the character dynamics other than Ringo and Saizo's (And when Ringo picked the Saizo's preferred options)\u30fcThe quirky answers are amusing. But then again, it's mostly because it reminds me a lot of the quirky answers Persona series has.\n\nAs for the party's dynamics (as far as this review goes), the current atmosphere feels like they're only characters bound by the same reason of \"being revived by Ringo\" and currently shares the same goal. But other than that, I have yet to see connection between each of the party members.\n\nNow onto Ringo and the other AI agent called \"Figue\". Again, for me, their dynamic felt a little too rushed for my comfort. They are both AI that was born on the same moment, with different personalities. In-game, they should only know each other a day or two, but the game made it seemed like Figue had known Ringo for a long time by worrying every each one of Ringo's actions like a doting parent. For me, it seemed incredibly stupid. So it's a bit hard to have attachments as of this time of writing.\n\n[h1]Graphics & Gameplay[/h1]\nThe graphics are phenomenal, especially the character models and designs\u30fcI fell in love the moment I first saw the trailer (esp. knowing Shirow Miwa is the character designer. I have loved sensei's design since 7th Dragon 2020), and it was actually the reason I bought the game in the first place.\n\nThe UI is clean and attractive as well. However, my only complaint so far would be the design for each dungeons. It felt so empty if you compared them to the Persona series.\n\nThe gameplay felt a little bit too repetitive with no real consequences (I play in Normal difficulty).\nWith no in-game days mechanics, you can go back and forth between the dungeons and the safehouse with no consequences other than your meal buff effects wore off the moment you leave a dungeon.\n\n[h1]Would I recommend others to buy this game?[/h1]\nAgain, I have not put in enough hours to give an overall verdict, but putting all my impressions so far\u30fcI would say only to get them if the game is on a discounted price (I bought the Digital Deluxe edition and for me it's honestly pricey. I would not say it if the game is otherwise worth the money).

The gameplay is closer to P4, but slightly simpler. There is no schedule mechanics, so if anything is similar with P5 Strikers in that aspect. You can and should build relationships with your party which is easy. Overall the game is good.\n\nIf you are wondering about negatives, there are few in my opinion. The party doesn't grow beyond a total of 4 members. The dungeon(s) that are dedicated to party members are generic in design (literally all look the same). You acquire the full party pretty quickly at the start since the story depends on having all 4 during the whole time (this may be seen as a negative to some).\n\nIn terms of DLC it is mainly cosmetic with 3 exceptions. 1. is a side mission DLC. 2. is a demons pack DLC which is probably the one that annoys people the most. 3. is a boost pack, which doesn't automatically break the game since every boost is actually an item so you have full control over when to use it.

Not to mention locking out demons, for whatever reason.\n\nThe game itself is fairly good. Characters are interesting, each one with a decent personality and backstory you can explore. The combat feels like any Person / Shin Megami Tensei game, just a little bit easier somehow.

I'd give it a solid 6.5/10. \nA good majority of the criticisms about this game will probably be centered around it not being enough like Persona or SMT; but as its own stand alone title it's not bad..\nsome of the issues I have with this game are as follows;\n1.Kinda pay to win. - First of all... Day 1 DLC??? I bought DLC with the game and I found out that as a level 15 I could summon a level 90 demon. On a normal occasion when doing fusions, it's impossible to get a demon higher than your level. I understand that you could easily just NOT summon them, but I know a lot of people wont really enjoy the game for what it is because they'll cheese it as much as possible. I also feel like this game will lose some replay value due to this as well. \n2.Fight mechanics- There is not really a system to hold people accountable for any combat whatsoever. You can literally hit most enemies, knock them down and run away. In fights It never seems beneficial to be conservative with your MP because you can always go back to the safehouse as much as you want without the story progressing to rest. \n3.Current state of game- Without making immediate adjustments to the game it feels like an Atlus game I would have played 10 years ago. After making some camera adjustments, It felt a little better, but it just doesnt feel up to par with most of the other current 60$ games to be released. I would 100% buy this game for 40$; but buying it for 60$ doesnt feel quite right. \n4.Graphics??? - 95% of this game is really graphically amazing. I think the stylistic choices made for this game carry it quite a bit. The only issue I have with how the game looks is just that some of the textures look like this game was made for the switch, and not for a new console with improved graphics. \n5.Story- I dont feel like there's a huuuuge amount of development in this game. Its probably better than SMT for sure but not persona if you /had/ to compare it to others.

I get this strong sense of the game being mostly handled by Atlus's B team while the A team works on an unannounced P6. \n\nThis game was built on Unity which, at least seems to offer a little more stability than UE4 did for Shin Megami Tensei V. Still, it leaves a product that feels less crafted and polished than P5 with it's proprietary engine did. \n\nThe textures, effects, lighting shadows, etc. Seem fine enough but they all have an early Ps4 game feel to them rather than a game that just released. No idea how long the development was on this title. \n\nUltimately, I am enjoying the game and will probably finish it. However, for anyone with a medium to low income, I'd say wait for a sale because this game doesn't seem to do anything to warrant a triple A price tag.\n\n\nEdit September 5, 2022:\nI have now finished the main game and the little DLC completing *most little side stuff and achievements along the way. \n\nIn my opinion the worst part of this game by a wide margin is the Soul Matrix. If you're at all interested in completing all 5 floors for each character you're very likely to spend more time in the Soul Matrix then the rest of the entire game combined. Considering that it basically looks the same on all 5 floors, with the addition of teleport pads on the higher floors, it is very, very tedious. \n\nThe second worst part of the game is the DLC dungeon \"Hachigaya Training Field\". This, much like the Soul Matrix but arguably worse since it's most the exact same floor duplicated over an over is extremely tedious. The actual Lost Numbers story and the character Nana is pretty fun and adds to the game but, this dungeon was super lazy. It could have all but 1 of it's floors removed and would pretty much be the same dungeon. \n\nIn a nutshell, those 2 dungeons feel like pitiful attempts to add playtime bulk to a rather thin game that is asking a triple A price. \n\nThe actual characters imo, are somewhat endearing however, 2 of them--I won't spoil much--just grow too quickly and end up acting about as off the rails stupid as I could imagine. The whole game feels like it takes place over the course of just a few weeks and it just doesn't track at all with the character progression for those 2. There needs to be like a whole middle of the game added to this game.\n\nFor people complaining about it being compared to Persona or Shin Megami Tensei get real... Even Atlus immediately threw Persona content into this game. Besides that, as far as the genre goes the easiest other games in the genre to compare it to are Atlus's other IPs. While this shouldn't be another Persona or SMT it should be comparable in detail quality or superior even now that Atlus is a much more successful studio than when they were developing P5. \n\nThe Joker costume for Ringo imo, is the way to go, I super dislike her vanilla outfit. Some of the Persona 5 music is being reused here but, that's not a bad thing, frankly the original music for Soul Hackers for me personally is a let down. \n\nOtherwise, it's a fun if a bit generic JRPG that feels like an early PS4 release despite being a 2022 release. If you've played hundreds or even just dozens of games in the genre you'll see tropes everywhere some bad some fine. I'd say wait for a sell unless you're a big JRPG fan that has money burning a hole in your account and you've already exhausted Steam's list of JRPGs that are better than this game.", "timestamp_created": 1661565962, "timestamp_updated": 1662326694, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502290427684783936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121295608": {"recommendationid": "121295608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134659040", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 104, "last_played": 1671307769}, "language": "english", "review": "ringo ass", "timestamp_created": 1661565013, "timestamp_updated": 1661565013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121294277": {"recommendationid": "121294277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060678829", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 637, "last_played": 1674253543}, "language": "english", "review": "grindy in terms of optional power scaling stuff but hella fun\n\nhas alot of dna from tokyo mirage sessions (smt x fe crossover)\n", "timestamp_created": 1661562420, "timestamp_updated": 1661562420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121294223": {"recommendationid": "121294223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075452162", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 3347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 453, "last_played": 1663479491}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: I beat it. More on that below. The main paragraph here still applies.\n\nBuy on sale if you really need an SMT hit. It's not bad, but they brought in a lot of persona influence and it feels like some weird middle ground between mainline and persona. Nothing wrong with the core gameplay loop, just a bunch of small things that drag the whole experience down. I wouldn't pick this as someone's first SMT game either.\n\nNo way Atlus looks at this, but Fog Breath's description is wrong. It says it lowers all stats, it actually only lowers attack/accuracy.\n\nGood news: looks good, combat is surprisingly interesting (although I'm at level 20 so who knows about later), battle transitions in dungeons are snappy. A lot of Raidou love (PC port where).\nThings I would love options for but don't expect: Remove the danger alert owl in the top right, he clashes with the background, is real noisy, and provides little useful information. I can hear when the demons spawn in...\nLower the amount of in battle dialogue, they are giving xenoblade a run for it's money and I've already given up and muted character voices.\nLet me walk faster. Please.\nLet me just warp into shops and save a load screen. Even on PC, on an SSD, it's ~5-10 seconds to load the area the shop is in, then enter the shop, buy my items and another load screen to leave. God help switch players.\nSimilarly, let me use safehouse functions from the map field. Spare me the load screen to heal.\n\nMajor whine: Main cast is main girl and 3 walking anime tropes. That wouldn't be a problem except a fair amount of this game is running their social links and helping them through their trope issues. So you know how their characters will work out, it's just waiting for the plot to catch up, and until then angst. \n\n--- I have now beaten this. I'll keep it basically spoiler free.\n\nThis was a surprisingly short SMT game. My profile says 55, I'd peg more around 45, I got distracted and idled a fair bit. That is also ignoring the 5 hours I spent wandering around quest locations looking for a doohickey, and the hours I spent half awake in teleporter mazes.\nNot sure how I feel about that, it didn't feel like the game got compressed or anything, it's just a shorter game. Except one way teleporter mazes where I can't mark the map, those suck. I hold by my original opinion: buy if you really need an SMT hit. Skip the DLC, even the extra story DLC, I assure you the extra story isn't worth 10 bucks.\n\nThings that fixed themselves: \n\nYou can unlock an ability to run faster. Shame you get it pretty deep in the game, it lasts for maybe a minute, and costs 10 mp. It also requires some very specific ability choices.\nThe cast's anime character tropes get resolved pretty fast all things considered. Mostly because the game moves fast but still.\nYou also get an \"instantly leave the dungeon\" spell. Very good.\n\nThings I am now confused about:\n\nYou can get equipable items that buff damage types, IE +50% fire damage. No such items for physical/gun damage... Why?\nIt has the SMT5 thing where you are constantly low on mana, but the game really wants you to spam spells to activate sabbaths. So lots of safehouse trips to top up...\nDLC demons get 1 free compendium summon, so you could just grab Satan from level 1 and steamroll.\nThe mistique thing is a real cool concept, to make you specialize what spells people are using. In practice to optimize sabbaths you want to zap the enemy with what they are weak against, so everyone is blasting the same spell type. So besides when you're farming the risky spawns for XP, or you die to a boss and are party rejigging, it doesn't see much play.\n\nThings I really grew to dislike:\nThere is a final alignment choice. I thought it would be determined by which party member has the highest soul link. It's actually SMT5 where they just ask you in the final dungeon which ending you want. It also appears to be 1 of 2 options, although I didn't reload to find out. I'm not even sure why the choices I picked gave me my ending, or why I should care.\nI wasn't exactly enthralled with the plot, but I was actually expecting a twist at the end, just because it felt like nothing happened. Nope, that was it.\nYou can only recruit demons by fighting them, then hoping you have a map event to recruit them. Makes it a PITA to drum up fusion fodder. Certain items and killing them with sabbath damage helps but you still don't get to pick who you want.\nFusing demons is also a pain, because demons have at max 6 skill slots, and are very restrictive as to what skills they will take. Not only are you trying to optimize the end result, you're also optimizing the intermediate demons so you can actually pass on skills you want.\nThe mind dungeon/Tartarus is... real dull. All the objectives in there, also real dull. Long, same looking, and teleport mazes.\nA real lack of scenery variety. You go to the docks twice, the sewers twice, and the office building twice. Only the last dungeon looks even remotely interesting.\nBig whine: some sidequests are basically: go to location X, find dude Y, do something. They don't mark where dude Y is on your map. Those 5 hours looking around dungeons to find dudes? I am not kidding.

Hard Mode is \"difficult\" not because of my strategy was wrong, but because my Level was too Low, absolutely annoying to deal with a boss that one shots you just for the sake of it.\n\nCompared to Soul Hackers 1 or even dare say Devil Summoner 1 (Sega Saturn), I can be underleveled but I can still defeat a boss with the right strategy, ex. a lvl 43 beating a lvl 60 boss, yes you heard that correct, a LVL 43 CAN DEFEAT A LVL 60 BOSS with the right strategy, doesn't exist in this game or any other JRPG that's not Megami Tensei. Mind you Devil Summoner 1 and Soul Hackers were never hard to begin with (Nemissa and Rei Reiho are OP AF), except for like three bosses in both games respectively (Orogone Ghost, Mayone and Inaruna). What I think is the most disappointing aspect is them removing negotiations to just talking to a demon, they ask for money or items and then bam you got a new demon, I tried to push through to see if they will introduce that into the game later on, but WHY TF do I have to wait for a staple of Megami Tensei since 1987 to be in the game, It should be there in the beginning. Never mind the scummy dlc demons or the battle items, but basically dumbing down negotiations just make me say, \"This ain't it Chief\". I did praise the buff system until I realize it is just like SMT V, it only lasts for three turns, smh. Just make everything a damage sponge, that seems to be the philosophy at ATLUS now instead of what made their series unique in the first place. I have no idea why the Loyalty System was removed, why not just make it like Raidou 2 where you level the loyalty up by grinding. The loyalty system was a hit or miss (Devil Summoner 1 is a prime example) but it was a chance for people that dislike it from SH1 to enjoy it.\n\nThe story isn't what makes me interested in Soul Hackers 2 or in Megami Tensei in the first place (SHOCKING! But it's true), it's a hot take but honestly the only games in the franchise that had stories that stood out to me were SMT II, SMT IV, Strange Journey, Persona 2 Eternal Punishment, Digital Devil Saga duology, and Raidou 2 (and maybe Majin Tensei 2, DeSU1 and Devil Summoner) compared to the rest of the series. So nothing more needs to be said about it.\n\nThe music is very underwhelming, One track to me felt really good to listen to and that was around the beginning of the game. Compared to both Devil Summoner games, those had amazing osts that oozed with style and atmosphere, thanks to Toshiko Tasaki and Tsukasa Masuko bringing it to life, now I don't have anything against okabe, but he doesn't scream Devil Summoner like Tasaki and Masuko does. Couldn't they just get Toshiko to supervise, it's one of the reasons why Soul Hackers ost is the way it is. \n\nFor me I would not recommend it full price but wait for it on sale maybe, but take my opinion with a grain of salt and formulate your own opinion, because you never you might actually enjoy the game.", "timestamp_created": 1661559798, "timestamp_updated": 1662577431, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50594562292098999", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121292469": {"recommendationid": "121292469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077708537", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 1107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 305, "last_played": 1674010665}, "language": "english", "review": "major persona vibes", "timestamp_created": 1661558940, "timestamp_updated": 1661558940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496807664632797241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121291889": {"recommendationid": "121291889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284837960", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 58, "last_played": 1662834214}, "language": "english", "review": "The intro song is pretty POG to be honest.", "timestamp_created": 1661557816, "timestamp_updated": 1661557816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536912739276885986", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121290981": {"recommendationid": "121290981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063507623", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 402, "last_played": 1661778169}, "language": "english", "review": "really liking the art style", "timestamp_created": 1661556173, "timestamp_updated": 1661556173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.49751242995262146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121290811": {"recommendationid": "121290811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040812353", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 232, "last_played": 1663574671}, "language": "english", "review": "Very promising for future PC titles from Atlus.

There's similarities but there's no date system so I don't feel as if I'm in a rush or got to be careful with who I spend my time with. Soul Link is similar to Confidants/Friendship from Persona, however its score based. Not a bad thing but it feels a little underwhelming so far probably because the characters haven't opened up yet.\n\nGameplay is fun and I know I'm going to get more crazy abilities later, decent PC controls, OST is pretty decent for its theme. I need to play more of the game to really make a decent opinion on this bit.\n\nDialogue boxes however are slow by default, and its annoying.

approachable for newcomers, a good entry for veterans but may feel a little oversimplified at times if you're used to the difficulty curve for SMT/Persona/DS games\n     - English voiceover is okay, but Japanese audio will make the game feel less awkward\n     - Agreed. Day 1 DLC is a pain, bought the extra story DLC and so far it has made very little impact on gameplay. Would love to see Atlus/Sega atone for this sin ;)\n     - Default settings for the game are terrible, fix your camera, text speed, etc ASAP when you start the game\n     - Music is solid\n     - Demon merging system is nice and simple with the new \"search fusion\" filters\n     - Character upgrade elements are an interesting take on the \"Glory\" mechanic that SMT 5 intoduced to the franchise\n     - Dungeons haven't been anything special but they haven't been a pain either\n     - Story is actually pretty good. Cutscenes and dialogue are a lot more lengthy and slightly less interesting than SMT 5 in my opinion, but if you're the kind of person who likes long storylines you'll like this one.\n     - So far I think a $40-$50 price tag would have made more sense for this game on release day since it does feel a bit watered down for a SMT/Persona/DS game but honestly you can justify buying it for $60 if you're pretty diehard on the franchise and want to play it ASAP and want a solid PC option until P5R gets ported.\n\nOverall I do recommend playing this game but perhaps waiting for a sale or solid free DLC drop if you've been on the fence about buying it. It doesn't quite justify the price tag just yet. \n", "timestamp_created": 1661516053, "timestamp_updated": 1661516053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.848409414291381836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "121262969": {"recommendationid": "121262969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006910508", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 301, "last_played": 1662194521}, "language": "english", "review": "After 5 hours of game, I can say it is a very enjoyable jrpg giving you the same feel as any other Atlus game. \n\nIf you liked the Persona series (more like the latest P5R), and the SMT series... you will love this one.\n\nOne caveat is that if you wanna play it on the hardest be prepared for some grinding...

I'll be back after finish this game right now let me get a quick nap.\n\nEdited: Here an honest review. Soul Hacker 2 is decent game. You have to play this game with low expectation you won't get Palace in P5 nor overworld dungeon like SMTV. Soul Hacker 2 Dungeon is separate in two dungeon Soul Matrix and overworld both of them required story progress, you're going to switch both dungeon along the story and won't get fancy decoration. It's dungeon crawler and yes it literally boring if you can't play dungeon like this I don't recommend. \n\nStory is not good not bad either. It's not difficult to understand story but story feels like wrap up too fast with no turning point you can predict story along the way. Relationship event AKA hangout is good it's best part in this game IMO. When playing feels lack of content not much build up story.\n\nCombat is like other jrpg Turn-base not hard to understand if you used to play jrpg Buff Debuff goes the same but some enemy is not easy if you fight unprepared you going to lose easily. Mine play with Hard difficult it not as hard other SMT. Best part of the game is fusion system I love Atlus game because fuse demon compared to SMT 3 or SMT V even goes all the way back to Soul Hacker 1 they have different ost each dungeon, battle.\n\nIn game soundtrack is great but it seem they lazy to compose multiple song. Combat ost there's like 4 songs that it. Dungeon ost only have 2 first overworld dungeon is all the same second Soul matrix ost is same every floor. \n\nIn the end this game is good but lack of content. My opinion if you going to buy wait for 30-50% discount. I bought premium edition it not worth the price with a few content and DLC.\n\nIf you going to get in to Atlus game I don\u2019t personally recommend.

If you're also a fan of the genre, it's definitely worth purchasing, especially when it's on sale. The game boasts a solid story, which seems like it draws inspiration from The Ghost in the Shell series. The characters each have their own personal traumas, which can be explored through the Axis, similar to Persona 5's Momentos level design. The game's artwork and sound are both exceptional, and the battle system, while different from previous SMT games, is still enjoyable, particularly with the addition of Sabbath actions that allow for customization and special actions that can be taken per turn that require some planning to make the most of out in boss battles. The character customization is a highlight, with the combination of augments and demons allowing for individual strengths to be maximized, individual characters affinity to be increased, and accessories and meals to buff the team.\n\nHowever, the level design is lackluster, with poorly thought-out mazes that feel tedious to navigate. Boss battles are particularly punishing (as expected, I played the game on hard), requiring grinding that can disrupt the pacing of the story, although this is typical of SMT games. Overall, the game offers a challenging and enjoyable experience, with its art, story, characters, battle system, and customization all impressing. While the level design may not be the best, it's a great follow-up to the original game and references it in subtle ways, but falls short in similar ways the original did.", "timestamp_created": 1677772560, "timestamp_updated": 1677772560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "133948708": {"recommendationid": "133948708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198825722267", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1037, "last_played": 1669176533}, "language": "english", "review": "Ringo is hot", "timestamp_created": 1677807283, "timestamp_updated": 1677807283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464071840047836304", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 580, "total_negative": 155, "total_reviews": 735}, "cursors": {"AoJ4mp+d7IIDcI/EzgM=": "Wed Mar  1 21:57:57 2023", "AoJwz9b84YQDcPDK5gM=": "Fri Mar  3 21:14:22 2023", "AoJw1cSo44QDdPTj5gM=": "Fri Mar  3 21:53:57 2023"}}
